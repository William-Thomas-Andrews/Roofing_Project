# Roofing Project

This repository holds the code I worked on for the startup company Compliancy. Unfortunately I did not upload this to github initially so there are no past versions available. There was a lot of trial and error and much more code than this. The code does not do exactly what we wanted it to do, so even though my internship is done, I will still keep working on this problem and now upload the changes here.

Project Description: Compliancy is a startup company based in the Miami-Dade and Broward county area in Florida, and it is their goal to help roofers pull permits faster. There are municipality websites that hold roofing permits which are often changed without notice. This makes trouble for roofers and slows down their process.
