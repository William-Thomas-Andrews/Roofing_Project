The owner’s initials in the designated space indicates that the item has \\\\nbeen explained.\\\\n❏ \\\\x07\\\\n1.\\\\t\\\\x07\\\\nAesthetics-workmanship: The workmanship provisions of Chapter 15 (High Velocity Hurricane Zone) are \\\\nfor the purpose of providing that the roofing system meets the wind resistance and water intrusion perfor-\\\\nmance standards. Aesthetics (appearance) are not a consideration with respect to workmanship provisions. \\\\nAesthetic issues such as color or architectural appearance, that are not part of a zoning code, should be \\\\naddressed as part of the agreement between the owner and the contractor.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n❏ \\\\x07\\\\n2.\\\\t \\\\x07\\\\nRenailing wood decks: When replacing roofing, the existing wood roof deck may have to be renailed in \\\\naccordance with the current provisions of Chapter 16 (High Velocity Hurricane Zones) of the Florida Building \\\\nCode. (The roof deck is usually concealed prior to removing the existing roof system).\\\\n\\\\x07❏ \\\\x07\\\\n3.\\\\t \\\\x07\\\\nCommon roofs: Common roofs are those which have no visible delineation between neighboring units \\\\n(i.e. townhouses, condominiums, etc.). In buildings with common roofs, the roofing contractor and/or owner \\\\nshould notify the occupants of adjacent units of roofing work to be performed.\\\\n❏ \\\\x07\\\\n4.\\\\t \\\\x07\\\\nExposed ceilings: Exposed, open beam ceilings are where the underside of the roof decking can be \\\\nviewed from below. The owner may wish to maintain the architectural appearance; therefore, roofing nail \\\\n\\\\xad\\\\npenetrations of the \\\\xad\\\\nunderside of the decking may not be acceptable. The owner provides the option of maintaining \\\\nthis appearance.\\\\n\\\\x07❏ \\\\x07\\\\n5.\\\\t \\\\x07\\\\nPonding water: The current roof system and/or deck of the building may not drain well and may cause wa-\\\\nter to pond (accumulate) in low-lying areas of the roof. Ponding can be an indication of structural distress \\\\nand may require the review of a professional structural engineer. Ponding may shorten the life expectancy \\\\nand performance of the new roofing system. Ponding conditions may not be evident until the original roofing \\\\nsystem is removed. Ponding \\\\xad\\\\nconditions should be corrected.\\\\n❏ \\\\x07\\\\n6. \\\\t\\\\x07\\\\nOverflow scuppers (wall outlets): It is required that rainwater flow off so that the roof is not overloaded \\\\nfrom a build up of water. Perimeter/edge walls or other roof extensions may block this discharge if overflow \\\\nscuppers (wall outlets) are not provided. It may be necessary to install overflow scuppers in accordance \\\\nwith the requirements of: Chapter 15 and 16 herein and the Florida Building Code, Plumbing.\\\\n❏ 7. \\\\x07\\\\nVentilation: Most roof structures should have some ability to vent natural airflow through the interior of the \\\\nstructural assembly (the building itself). The existing amount of attic ventilation shall not be reduced.\\\\n❏ 8. \\\\x07\\\\nExisting Solar Systems: The re-installation of an existing roof mounted photovoltaic system requires a \\\\n\\\\xad\\\\nseparate permit. Permit must be obtained in order to finalize the roofing permit.\\\\n \\\\n123_01-297\\\\u2002 4/19\\\\nCONTRACTOR’S SIGNATURE\\\\nPERMIT NUMBER\\\\nPROPERTY ADDRESS\\\\nSTATE\\\\nZIP\\\\nOWNER’S\\\\u2009\\\\n/AGEN’TS SIGNATURE\\\\nDATE\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\n'}\",\n",

However, it does not apply to the repair\\\\nor replacement of an existing heating or air conditioning system\\\\nless than $7,500.00 in value. This notice must be signed by you,\\\\nthe property owner.\\\\nUnder Florida law, those who work on your property or\\\\nprovide materials and are not paid, have a right to enforce their\\\\nclaim for payment against your property. This claim is known as\\\\na construction lien.\\\\nYou may receive a Notice to Owner from subcontractors\\\\nand material suppliers. This notice advises you that the sender\\\\nis providing services or materials. Subcontractors and suppliers\\\\nmust serve a Notice to Owner within 45 days of commencing\\\\nwork to preserve their ability to lien your property.\\\\nIf your address changes from that given in the Notice of\\\\nCommencement, you should record a corrected Notice reflecting\\\\nyour current address. This is done to help ensure you will receive\\\\nall notices.\\\\nRELEASE FROM LIEN FROM CONTRACTOR\\\\nYOU MUST FILE A NOTICE\\\\nPrior to paying the contractor, you need to receive a Release\\\\nof Lien and Affidavit to the extent of payment from the general\\\\ncontractor. The Release of Lien and Affidavit shall state either\\\\nthat all the subcontractors and suppliers have been paid or list\\\\nthose unpaid and the amount owed. The contractor is required\\\\nto list on the Release of Lien and Affidavit any subcontractor or\\\\nsupplier that has not been paid. That amount may be withheld\\\\nfrom the contractor\\'s pay and paid directly to the subcontractor\\\\nor suppliers after 10 days written notice to the contractor.\\\\nIf the balance due to the contractor is not sufficient to pay\\\\nin full all subcontractors and suppliers listed on the contractor\\'s\\\\naffidavit, you may wish to consult an attorney.\\\\nThe general contractor shall furnish a final Release of Lien\\\\nand Affidavit to the owner indicating all subcontractors and\\\\nsuppliers have been paid at the time he requests final payment.\\\\nYou can rely on the affidavit in making final payment to the\\\\ngeneral contractor. If you make final payment to the general\\\\ncontractor without obtaining the affidavit, your property can be\\\\nliened for non-payment if the general contractor fails to pay the\\\\nsubcontractors or suppliers. You should always obtain a Release of\\\\nLien and Affidavit from the contractor to the extent of any payments\\\\nbeing made.\\\\nOF COMMENCEMENT\\\\nFor your protection under the Construction Lien Law and to\\\\navoid the possibility of paying twice for improvements to real\\\\nproperty, you must record a Notice of Commencement in the\\\\nClerk of the Court\\'s Office. You also must provide a certified copy\\\\nof the recorded document at the construction site. The Notice of\\\\nCommencement must be signed by you, the owner contracting\\\\nthe improvements, and not by your agent.\\\\nThe Notice of Commencement form, provided with this\\\\ninformation packet, must be completed and recorded within 90\\\\ndays before starting the work.\\\\nA copy of the payment bond, if any is required by you and\\\\npurchased by the contractor, must be attached as part of the\\\\nNotice of Commencement when recorded.\\\\nIf improvements described in the Notice of Commencement\\\\nare not actually started within 90 days after the recording of the\\\\nNotice, a new Notice of Commencement must be recorded.\\\\nYou lose your protection under the Construction Lien Law if\\\\nthe payments are made to the contractor after the expiration of\\\\nthe Notice of Commencement. The Notice is good for one year\\\\nafter the recording date or up to the date specified under item\\\\nnine of the form.\\\\nFlorida law requires the Department of Regulatory and\\\\nEconomic Resources to be a second source of information\\\\nconcerning the improvements made on real property.

       " \"{'page_1': 'Section 1524 FBC \\\\nHIGH VELOCITY HURRICANE ZONES \\\\nREQUIRED OWNERS NOTIFICATION FOR ROOFING CONSIDERATIONS\\\\nIt is the responsibility of the roofing contractor to provide the owner with the required roofing permit, \\\\nand to explain to the owner the content of this form. The owner’s initials in the designated space \\\\nindicates that the item has been explained. \\\\n❏1. Aesthetics-workmanship: The workmanship provisions of Chapter 15 (High Velocity Hurricane\\\\nZone) are for the purpose of providing that the roofing system meets the wind resistance and water\\\\nintrusion performance standards. Aesthetics (appearance) are not a consideration with respect to\\\\nworkmanship provisions. Aesthetic issues such as color or architectural appearance, that are not part of\\\\na zoning code, should be addressed as part of the agreement between the owner and the contractor.\\\\n❏2. Renailing wood decks: When replacing roofing, the existing wood roof deck may have to be\\\\nrenailed in accordance with the current provisions of Chapter 16 (High Velocity Hurricane Zones) of the \\\\nFlorida Building Code. (The roof deck is usually concealed prior to removing the existing roof system).  \\\\n❏3. Common roofs: Common roofs are those which have no visible delineation between neighboring\\\\nunits (i.e. townhouses, condominiums, etc.). In buildings with common roofs, the roofing contractor and/or \\\\nowner should notify the occupants of adjacent units of roofing work to be performed. \\\\n❏4. Exposed ceilings: Exposed, open beam ceilings are where the underside of the roof decking can\\\\nbe viewed from below. The owner may wish to maintain the architectural appearance; therefore, roofing\\\\nnail penetrations of the underside of the decking may not be acceptable. The owner provides the option of\\\\nmaintaining this appearance.\\\\n❏5. Ponding water: The current roof system and/or deck of the building may not drain well and may\\\\ncause water to pond (accumulate) in low-lying areas of the roof. Ponding can be an indication of structural\\\\ndistress and may require the review of a professional structural engineer. Ponding may shorten the life\\\\nexpectancy and performance of the new roofing system. Ponding conditions may not be evident until the\\\\noriginal roofing system is removed. Ponding conditions should be corrected.\\\\n❏6. Overflow scuppers (wall outlets): It is required that rainwater flow off so that the roof is not\\\\noverloaded from a buildup of water. Perimeter/edge walls or other roof extensions may block this\\\\ndischarge if overflow scuppers (wall outlets) are not provided. It may be necessary to install overflow\\\\nscuppers in accordance with the requirements of: Chapter 15 and 16 herein and the Florida Building Code,\\\\nPlumbing.\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\n', 'page_2': '❏7. Ventilation: Most roof structures should have some ability to vent natural airflow through the\\\\ninterior of the structural assembly (the building itself). The existing amount of attic ventilation shall not\\\\nbe reduced.\\\\n❏8. Existing Solar Systems: The re-installation of an existing roof mounted photovoltaic system\\\\nrequires a separate permit. Permit must be obtained in order to finalize the roofing permit.\\\\n________________________________ \\\\n____________ \\\\nContractor’s Signature \\\\nDate \\\\n_____________________________ \\\\n___________ \\\\nOwner’s/Agent’s Signature   \\\\nDate \\\\nProperty Address: _______________________________________________________________ \\\\nCity: _____________  State: _____________  Zip: _______________ \\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\n'}\",\n",

The owner’s initials in the designated space indicates that the item has \\\\nbeen explained.\\\\nR\\\\x03 \\\\x03\\\\n1.  \\\\nAesthetics-workmanship: The workmanship provisions of Chapter 15 (High Velocity Hurricane Zone)\\\\n \\\\n \\\\nR\\\\x03 \\\\x03\\\\n2.  \\\\nRenailing wood decks: When replacing rooﬁng, the existing wood roof deck may have to be renailed in\\\\naccordance with the current provisions of Chapter 16 (High Velocity Hurricane Zones) of the Florida Building \\\\nCode. (The roof deck is usually concealed prior to removing the existing roof system).\\\\n R\\\\x03 \\\\x03\\\\n3.  \\\\nCommon roofs: Common roofs are those which have no visible delineation between neighboring units\\\\n(i.e. townhouses, condominiums, etc.). In buildings with common roofs, the rooﬁng contractor and/or owner \\\\nshould notify the occupants of adjacent units of rooﬁng work to be performed.\\\\nR\\\\x03 \\\\x03\\\\n4.  \\\\nExposed ceilings: Exposed, open beam ceilings are where the underside of the roof decking can be\\\\nviewed from below. The owner may wish to maintain the architectural appearance; therefore, rooﬁng nail \\\\n \\\\npenetrations of the  \\\\nunderside of the decking may not be acceptable. The owner provides the option of maintaining \\\\nthis appearance.\\\\n R\\\\x03 \\\\x03\\\\n5.  \\\\nPonding water: The current roof system and/or deck of the building may not drain well and may cause wa-\\\\nter to pond (accumulate) in low-lying areas of the roof. Ponding can be an indication of structural distress \\\\nand may require the review of a professional structural engineer. Ponding may shorten the life expectancy \\\\nand performance of the new rooﬁng system. Ponding conditions may not be evident until the original rooﬁng \\\\nsystem is removed. Ponding  \\\\nconditions should be corrected.\\\\nR\\\\x03 \\\\x03\\\\n6.   \\\\nOverﬂow scuppers (wall outlets): It is required that rainwater ﬂow off so that the roof is not overloaded\\\\nfrom a build up of water. Perimeter/edge walls or other roof extensions may block this discharge if overﬂow \\\\nscuppers (wall outlets) are not provided. It may be necessary to install overﬂow scuppers in accordance \\\\nwith the requirements of: Chapter 15 and 16 herein and the Florida Building Code, Plumbing.\\\\nR\\\\x03 7.  \\\\nVentilation: Most roof structures should have some ability to vent natural airﬂow through the interior of the\\\\nstructural assembly (the building itself). The existing amount of attic ventilation shall not be reduced.\\\\nR\\\\x03 8.  \\\\nExisting Solar Systems: The re-installation of an existing roof mounted photovoltaic system requires a\\\\n \\\\nseparate permit.

       " '{\\'page_1\\': \"  \\\\nREQUIRED OWNERS NOTIFICATION FOR ROOFING CONSIDERATIONS \\\\nIt is the responsibility of the roofing contractor to provide the owner with the required roofing permit, and to \\\\nexplain to the owner the content of this form.  The owner\\'s initials in the designated space indicates that the item \\\\nhas been explained.\\\\n1. Aesthetics-workmanship:  The workmanship provisions of Chapter 15 (High Velocity Hurricane\\\\nZone) are for the purpose of providing that the roofing system meets the wind resistance and water intrusion \\\\nperformance standards.  Aesthetics (appearance) are not a consideration with respect to workmanship provisions.  \\\\nAesthetic issues such as color or architectural appearance, that are not part of a zoning code, should be addressed \\\\nas part of the agreement between the owner and the contractor.\\\\n2. Renailing wood decks:  When replacing roofing, the existing wood roof deck may have to be\\\\nrenailed in accordance with the current provisions of Chapter 16 (High Velocity Hurricane Zones) of the Florida \\\\nBuilding Code.  (The roof deck is usually concealed prior to removing the existing roof system).\\\\n3. Common roofs:  Common roofs are those which have no visible delineation between neighboring\\\\nunits (i.e. townhouses, condominiums, etc.). In buildings with common roofs, the roofing contractor and/or \\\\nowner should notify the occupants of adjacent units of roofing work to be performed.\\\\n4. Exposed ceilings:  Exposed, open beam ceilings are where the underside of the roof decking can be\\\\nviewed from below.  The owner may wish to maintain the architectural appearance; therefore, roofing nail \\\\npenetrations of the underside of the decking may not be acceptable. The owner provides the option of \\\\nmaintaining this appearance.\\\\n5. Ponding water:  The current roof system and/or deck of the building may not drain well and may\\\\ncause water to pond (accumulate) in low-lying areas of the roof.  Ponding can be an indication of structural \\\\ndistress and may require the review of a professional structural engineer. Ponding may shorten the life \\\\nexpectancy and performance of the new roofing system.  Ponding conditions may not be evident until the original \\\\nroofing system is removed.  Ponding conditions should be corrected.\\\\n6. Overflow scuppers (wall outlets):  It is required that rainwater flow off so that the roof is not\\\\noverloaded from a build up of water.  Perimeter/edge walls or other roof extensions may block this discharge if \\\\noverflow scuppers (wall outlets) are not provided.  It may be necessary to install overflow scuppers in accordance \\\\nwith the requirements of:  Chapter 15 and 16 herein and the Florida Building Code, Plumbing.\\\\n7. Ventilation:  Most roof structures should have some ability to vent natural airflow through the\\\\ninterior of the structural assembly (the building itself).  The existing amount of attic ventilation shall not be \\\\nreduced.  \\\\nOwner\\'s/Agent\\'s Signature:   \\\\n     Date:   \\\\n / \\\\n / \\\\nContractor\\'s Signature:   \\\\n     Permit Number:   \\\\nProperty Address:   \\\\n\"}',\n",

The owner\\'s initials in the designated space indicates that the item \\\\nhas been explained.\\\\n1. Aesthetics-workmanship:  The workmanship provisions of Chapter 15 (High Velocity Hurricane\\\\nZone) are for the purpose of providing that the roofing system meets the wind resistance and water intrusion \\\\nperformance standards.  Aesthetics (appearance) are not a consideration with respect to workmanship provisions.  \\\\nAesthetic issues such as color or architectural appearance, that are not part of a zoning code, should be addressed \\\\nas part of the agreement between the owner and the contractor.\\\\n2. Renailing wood decks:  When replacing roofing, the existing wood roof deck may have to be\\\\nrenailed in accordance with the current provisions of Chapter 16 (High Velocity Hurricane Zones) of the Florida \\\\nBuilding Code.  (The roof deck is usually concealed prior to removing the existing roof system).\\\\n3. Common roofs:  Common roofs are those which have no visible delineation between neighboring\\\\nunits (i.e. townhouses, condominiums, etc.). In buildings with common roofs, the roofing contractor and/or \\\\nowner should notify the occupants of adjacent units of roofing work to be performed.\\\\n4. Exposed ceilings:  Exposed, open beam ceilings are where the underside of the roof decking can be\\\\nviewed from below.  The owner may wish to maintain the architectural appearance; therefore, roofing nail \\\\npenetrations of the underside of the decking may not be acceptable. The owner provides the option of \\\\nmaintaining this appearance.\\\\n5. Ponding water:  The current roof system and/or deck of the building may not drain well and may\\\\ncause water to pond (accumulate) in low-lying areas of the roof.  Ponding can be an indication of structural \\\\ndistress and may require the review of a professional structural engineer. Ponding may shorten the life \\\\nexpectancy and performance of the new roofing system.  Ponding conditions may not be evident until the original \\\\nroofing system is removed.  Ponding conditions should be corrected.\\\\n6. Overflow scuppers (wall outlets):  It is required that rainwater flow off so that the roof is not\\\\noverloaded from a build up of water.  Perimeter/edge walls or other roof extensions may block this discharge if \\\\noverflow scuppers (wall outlets) are not provided.  It may be necessary to install overflow scuppers in accordance \\\\nwith the requirements of:  Chapter 15 and 16 herein and the Florida Building Code, Plumbing.\\\\n7. Ventilation:  Most roof structures should have some ability to vent natural airflow through the\\\\ninterior of the structural assembly (the building itself).  The existing amount of attic ventilation shall not be \\\\nreduced.  \\\\nOwner\\'s/Agent\\'s Signature:   \\\\n     Date:   \\\\n / \\\\n / \\\\nContractor\\'s Signature:   \\\\n     Permit Number:   \\\\nProperty Address:   \\\\n\"}',\n",

The provisions of Chapter 15 of the 2020 Florida \\\\nBuilding Code, Building govern the minimum requirements and standards of the industry for roofing system \\\\ninstallations. Additionally, the following items should be addressed as part of the agreement between the owner and \\\\nthe contractor. The owner’s initial in the designated space indicates that the item has been explained. \\\\n__________1. Aesthetics-workmanship: The workmanship provisions of Chapter 15 (High-Velocity Hurricane \\\\nZone) are for the purpose of providing that the roofing system meets the wind resistance and water intrusion \\\\nperformance standards. Aesthetics (appearance) are not a consideration with respect to workmanship provisions. \\\\nAesthetic issues such as color or architectural appearance, that are not part of a zoning code, should be addressed as \\\\npart of the agreement between the owner and the contractor. \\\\n__________2. Re-nailing wood decks: When replacing roofing, the existing wood roof deck may have to be re-nailed \\\\nin accordance with the current provisions of Chapter 16 (High-Velocity Hurricane Zones) of the. (The roof deck is \\\\nusually concealed prior to removing the existing roof system.) \\\\n__________3. Common roofs: Common roofs are those which have no visible delineation between neighboring units \\\\n(i.e., townhouses, condominiums, etc.). In buildings with common roofs, the roofing contractor and/or owner should \\\\nnotify the occupants of adjacent units of roofing work to be performed. \\\\n__________4. Exposed ceilings: Exposed, open beam ceilings are where the underside of the roof decking can be \\\\nviewed from below. The owner may wish to maintain the architectural appearance; therefore, roofing nail penetrations \\\\nof the underside of the decking may not be acceptable. The owner provides the option of maintaining this appearance. \\\\n__________5. Ponding water: The current roof system and/or deck of the building may not drain well and may cause \\\\nwater to pond (accumulate) in low-lying areas of the roof. Ponding can be an indication of structural distress and may \\\\nrequire the review of a professional structural engineer. Ponding may shorten the life expectancy and performance of \\\\nthe new roofing system. Ponding conditions may not be evident until the original roofing system is removed. Ponding \\\\nconditions should be corrected. \\\\n__________6. Overflow scuppers (wall outlets): It is required that rainwater flows off so that the roof is not \\\\noverloaded from a buildup of water. Perimeter/edge walls or other roof extensions may block this discharge if overflow \\\\nscuppers (wall outlets) are not provided. It may be necessary to install overflow scuppers in accordance with the \\\\nrequirements of: Chapter 15 and 16 herein and the 2020 Florida Building Code, Plumbing. \\\\n__________7. Ventilation: Most roof structures should have some ability to vent natural airflow through the interior \\\\nof the structural assembly (the building itself). The existing amount of attic ventilation shall not be reduced. It may be \\\\nbeneficial to consider additional venting which can result in extending the service life of the roof. \\\\nOwner’s/Agent’s Signature \\\\nDate \\\\nContractor’s Signature \\\\nDate \\\\nProperty Address \\\\nProcess/Permit Number \\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\n'}\",\n",

Corporate officers \\\\nor members of a limited liability company (LLC) in the construction industry may elect to be \\\\nexempt if: \\\\n1.

Construction exemptions are valid for a period of two years or until a \\\\nvoluntary revocation is filed or the exemption is revoked by the Division. \\\\nYour contractor is requesting a permit under this workers’ compensation exemption. In these circumstances, the City of Miami \\\\nGardens does not require verification of workers’ compensation insurance coverage from the contractor’s company.

Legal description and name on document of proof must correspond to the name and legal \\\\ndescription on the application. \\\\nProperty Information: (If the property is unaddressed, address must be assigned prior to permitting.) \\\\nProperty Address: ___________________________________________________________________ \\\\nFolio No.: ___________________________________________________________________________ \\\\nProperty Owner Information: \\\\nProperty Owner Name: ____________________________________________________________________ \\\\nProperty Owner Address: __________________________________________________________________ \\\\nProperty Owner Email: ____________________________________________________________________ \\\\nProperty Owner Telephone Number: ______________________________________________________ \\\\nOwner’s Certification: \\\\nFurthermore, as an owner-builder, I hereby certify and state: \\\\n1.\\\\nI understand that state law and County code requires construction to be done by a licensed contractor and\\\\nhave applied for an owner-builder permit under an exemption from the laws. The exemption specifies that\\\\nI, as the owner of the property listed, may act as my own contractor with certain restrictions even though I\\\\ndo not have a license.\\\\n2.\\\\nI understand that building permits are required to be signed by a property owner unless he or she is\\\\nresponsible for the construction and is not hiring a licensed contractor to assume responsibility.\\\\n3.\\\\nI understand that, as an owner-builder, I am the responsible party of record on a permit. I understand that I\\\\nmay protect myself from potential financial risk by hiring a licensed contractor and having the permit filed\\\\nin his or her name instead of my own name. I also understand that a contractor is required by law to be\\\\nlicensed by the state of Florida or Miami-Dade County and to list his or her license numbers on permits and\\\\ncontracts.\\\\n4.\\\\nI understand that I may build or improve a one-family or two-family residence or a farm outbuilding. I may\\\\nalso build a one-story building or addition of not more than 500 square feet for commercial use or perform\\\\nmaintenance or repairs not to exceed $5,000 on any building I own or lease. The building or residence must\\\\nbe for my own use or occupancy. It may not be built or substantially improved for sale or lease, unless I am\\\\ncompleting the requirements of a building permit where the contractor listed on the permit substantially\\\\ncompleted the project. If a building or residence that I have built or substantially improved myself is sold or\\\\nleased within 24-months of permit issuances, the law will presume that I built or substantially improved it\\\\nfor sale or lease, which violates the exemption, and I will be subject to further enforcement action.\\\\n5.\\\\nI understand that, as the owner-builder, I must provide direct, onsite supervision of the construction.\\\\n6.\\\\nI understand that I may not hire an unlicensed person to act as my contractor or to supervise persons\\\\nworking on my building or residence. It is my responsibility to ensure that the persons whom I employ have\\\\nthe licenses required by law and by county or municipal ordinance. Anyone contracting, including labor,\\\\nwith me, verbally or in writing, who are not properly licensed may be subject to a fine of $500 and or\\\\nimprisonment for six months.\\\\n', 'page_2': 'Town of Cutler Bay Owner-Builder Disclosure \\\\n Page 2 of 2 \\\\n(Rev. 05/22) \\\\nPermit No: _____________________ \\\\nAddress: _______________________ \\\\n7.\\\\nI understand that it is a frequent practice of unlicensed persons to have the property owner obtain an\\\\nowner- builder permit that erroneously implies that the property owner is providing his or her own labor\\\\nand materials. I, as an owner-builder, may be held liable and subjected to serious financial risk for any injuries\\\\nsustained by an unlicensed person or his or her employees while working on my property. My homeowner’s\\\\ninsurance may not provide coverage for those injuries. I am willfully acting as an owner-builder and am\\\\naware of the limits of my insurance coverage for injuries to workers on my property.\\\\n8.\\\\nI understand that I may not delegate the responsibility for supervising work to a licensed contractor who is\\\\nnot licensed to perform the work being done. Any person working on my building who is not licensed must\\\\nwork under my direct supervision and must be employed by me, which means that I must comply with laws\\\\nrequiring the withholding of federal income tax and social security contributions under the Federal\\\\nInsurance Contributions Act (FICA) and must provide workers’ compensation for the employee. I\\\\nunderstand that my failure to follow these laws may subject me to serious financial risk.\\\\n9.\\\\nI agree that, as the party legally and financially responsible for this proposed construction activity, I will abide\\\\nby all applicable laws and requirements that govern owner-builders as well as employers. I also understand\\\\nthat the construction must comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, building codes, and zoning\\\\nregulations.\\\\n10. I understand that I may obtain more information regarding my obligations as an employer from the Internal\\\\nRevenue Service, the United States Small Business Administration, the Florida Department of Financial\\\\nServices, and the Florida Department of Revenue. I also understand that I may contact the Florida\\\\nConstruction Industry Licensing Board for more information about licensed contractors.\\\\n11.\\\\nI am aware of, and consent to, an owner-builder building permit applied for in my name and understand\\\\nthat I am the party legally and financially responsible for the proposed construction activity at the following\\\\naddress: ____________________________________________________________________________________.\\\\n12. I agree to notify Town of Cutler Bay Building Division immediately of any additions, deletions, or changes to\\\\nany of the information that I have provided on this disclosure.\\\\nLicensed contractors are regulated by laws designed to protect the public. If you contract with a person who \\\\ndoes not have a license, the Construction Industry Licensing Board and Department of Business and \\\\nProfessional Regulation may be unable to assist you with any financial loss that you sustain as a result of a \\\\ncomplaint. Your only remedy against an unlicensed contractor may be in civil court. It is also important for you \\\\nto understand that, if an unlicensed contractor or employee of an individual or firm is injured while working on \\\\nyour property, you may be held liable for damages. If you obtain an owner-builder permit and wish to hire a \\\\nlicensed contractor, you will be responsible for verifying whether the contractor is properly licensed and the \\\\nstatus of the contractor’s workers’ compensation coverage. \\\\nBefore a building permit can be issued, this disclosure statement must be completed and signed by the \\\\nproperty owner and returned to the local permitting agency responsible for issuing the permit. A copy of the \\\\nproperty owner’s driver license, the notarized signature of the property owner, or other type of verification \\\\nacceptable to the local permitting agency is required before the permit is issued. \\\\nI, the owner of property located at address __________________________________________________ do hereby \\\\ncertify that I maintain the level of competency and the knowledge of the Florida Building Code necessary \\\\nto assume the scope of work identified by the permit I have applied for. I will not undertake any work for \\\\nwhich I do not feel I have sufficient competent knowledge of, and I will supervise all hired laborers, or hire \\\\nlicensed contractors.

The Florida \\\\nAdministrative Rule implementing the Legislature\\'s mandate was adopted by the Commission at its August 21, 2007 \\\\nmeeting and will be in effect in October as directed. \\\\nPlease Note: The intended requirements apply to pre-Florida Building Code construction. The law requires mitigation \\\\nretrofits for site-built and single family residential structures. For a summary of mitigation requirements and for \\\\nspecific information on the law, please see Ch. 2007-126, online: \\\\nhttp://election.dos.state.fl.us/laws/07laws/convframe.html \\\\nFor specifics on the mitigation techniques and requirements see the Commission website: \\\\nhttp://www.dca.state.fl.us/fbc/thecode/1_code_modifications.htm \\\\nRESIDENTIAL RE-ROOFING \\\\nAll re-roofing permits for single family residences constructed prior to the implementation of the Florida Building Code \\\\nmust execute a Special Inspector form from an Architect or Engineer licensed in Florida, which will need to certify the \\\\nfollowing items and submit photography for each: \\\\nA. \\\\nRe-nailing of sheathing as required by Section 507.2.2 of the Florida Building Code, HVHZ.  \\\\nB. \\\\nCertification of the roof secondary water barrier. \\\\nWhen the single family home structure is: \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 \\\\nInsured valued at $300,000 or more; or \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 \\\\nThe structure is uninsured; or \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 \\\\nWhen insured value documentation is not presented has a just valuation for the structure for the \\\\npurposes of ad valorem taxation of $300,000 or more. \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 \\\\n \\\\nThe special inspector must certify that the roof to wall connections comply with the Florida Building Code (FBC) \\\\nprovisions. If the connections are not in compliance with the FBC, then a separate building permit is required for \\\\nretrofitting the roof to wall connection. \\\\nA secondary water barrier should be installed using one of the following mitigation techniques offered in the Florida \\\\nCommission Mitigation Retrofit Manual (refer to website noted above): \\\\n1. \\\\nOption “A” - All joints in roof sheathing or decking shall be covered with a minimum 4” wide strip of self \\\\nadhering polymer modified bitumen tape applied directly to sheathing or decking; or \\\\n2. \\\\n“The Exceptions” - Asphalt impregnated #30 felt underlayment attached with nails and tin-caps complying \\\\nwith HVHZ of Florida Building Code 2004 HVHZ, and covered with either self adhering polymer modified bitumen cap \\\\nsheet or an approved hot mop application complies with the secondary water barrier requirements. \\\\n\"}',\n",
       " \"{'page_1': 'REQUIRED OWNERS NOTIFICATION FOR \\\\n ROOFING CONSIDERATIONS\\\\nIt is the responsibility of the rooﬁng contractor to provide the owner with the required rooﬁng permit, and to ex-\\\\nplain to the owner the content of this form. The owner’s initials in the designated space indicates that the item has \\\\nbeen explained.\\\\n❏  \\\\n1.  \\\\nAesthetics-workmanship: The workmanship provisions of Chapter 15 (High Velocity Hurricane Zone) are \\\\nfor the purpose of providing that the rooﬁng system meets the wind resistance and water intrusion perfor-\\\\nmance standards. Aesthetics (appearance) are not a consideration with respect to workmanship provisions. \\\\nAesthetic issues such as color or architectural appearance, that are not part of a zoning code, should be \\\\naddressed as part of the agreement between the owner and the contractor.\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n❏  \\\\n2.  \\\\nRenailing wood decks: When replacing rooﬁng, the existing wood roof deck may have to be renailed in \\\\naccordance with the current provisions of Chapter 16 (High Velocity Hurricane Zones) of the Florida Building \\\\nCode. (The roof deck is usually concealed prior to removing the existing roof system).\\\\n ❏  \\\\n3.  \\\\nCommon roofs: Common roofs are those which have no visible delineation between neighboring units \\\\n(i.e. townhouses, condominiums, etc.). In buildings with common roofs, the rooﬁng contractor and/or owner \\\\nshould notify the occupants of adjacent units of rooﬁng work to be performed.\\\\n❏  \\\\n4.  \\\\nExposed ceilings: Exposed, open beam ceilings are where the underside of the roof decking can be \\\\nviewed from below. The owner may wish to maintain the architectural appearance; therefore, rooﬁng nail \\\\n \\\\npenetrations of the  \\\\nunderside of the decking may not be acceptable. The owner provides the option of maintaining \\\\nthis appearance.\\\\n ❏  \\\\n5.  \\\\nPonding water: The current roof system and/or deck of the building may not drain well and may cause wa-\\\\nter to pond (accumulate) in low-lying areas of the roof. Ponding can be an indication of structural distress \\\\nand may require the review of a professional structural engineer. Ponding may shorten the life expectancy \\\\nand performance of the new rooﬁng system. Ponding conditions may not be evident until the original rooﬁng \\\\nsystem is removed. Ponding  \\\\nconditions should be corrected.\\\\n❏  \\\\n6.   \\\\nOverﬂow scuppers (wall outlets): It is required that rainwater ﬂow off so that the roof is not overloaded \\\\nfrom a build up of water. Perimeter/edge walls or other roof extensions may block this discharge if overﬂow \\\\nscuppers (wall outlets) are not provided. It may be necessary to install overﬂow scuppers in accordance \\\\nwith the requirements of: Chapter 15 and 16 herein and the Florida Building Code, Plumbing.\\\\n❏ 7.  \\\\nVentilation: Most roof structures should have some ability to vent natural airﬂow through the interior of the \\\\nstructural assembly (the building itself). The existing amount of attic ventilation shall not be reduced.\\\\n❏ 8.  \\\\nExisting Solar Systems: The re-installation of an existing roof mounted photovoltaic system requires a \\\\n \\\\nseparate permit. Permit must be obtained in order to ﬁnalize the rooﬁng permit.\\\\n \\\\nCONTRACTOR’S SIGNATURE\\\\nPERMIT NUMBER\\\\nPROPERTY ADDRESS\\\\nSTATE\\\\nZIP\\\\nOWNER’S \\\\n/AGEN’TS SIGNATURE\\\\nDATE\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\n'}\",\n",

       " \"{'page_1': 'City of Miami Springs \\\\nBuilding and Zoning Department \\\\nOwner’s Notification for Roofing Permits issued under the Florida Building Code \\\\n \\\\nSection 1524-High Velocity Hurricane Zones Required Owners Notification for Roofing Considerations \\\\n \\\\n1524.1 As it pertains to this section, it is the responsibility of the roofing contractor to provide the owner with the required \\\\nroofing permit, and to explain to the owner the content of this section.  The provisions of Chapter 15 of the Florida Building \\\\nCode, Building, govern the minimum requirements and standards of the industry for roofing system installations.  \\\\nAdditionally, the following items should be addressed as part of the agreement between the owner and the contractor.  The \\\\nowner’s initials in the adjacent boxes indicate that the item has been explained. \\\\n \\\\n______1. Aesthetics-Workmanship: The workmanship provisions of Chapter 15 (High Velocity Hurricane Zone) are for the \\\\npurpose of providing that the roofing system meets the wind resistance and water intrusion performance standards.  \\\\nAesthetics (appearance) issues are not a consideration with respect to workmanship provisions.  Aesthetic issues such as \\\\ncolor or architectural appearance, that are not part of a zoning code, should be addressed as part of the agreement between \\\\nthe owner and the contractor. \\\\n \\\\n______2. Renailing Wood Decks: When replacing roofing, the existing wood roof deck may have to be renailed in accordance \\\\nwith the current provisions of Chapter 15 (High Velocity Hurricane Zones) of the Florida Building Code.  (The roof deck is \\\\nusually concealed prior to removing the existing roof system).  NOTE: Certification for renailing must be signed and returned \\\\non a separate form! \\\\n \\\\n______3. Common Roofs: Common roofs are those which have no visible delineation between neighboring units (i.e. \\\\ntownhouses, condominiums, etc.).  In buildings with common roofs, the roofing contractor and/or owner should notify the \\\\noccupants of adjacent units of roofing work to be performed. \\\\n \\\\n______4. Exposed Ceilings: Exposed, open beam ceilings are where the underside of the roof decking can be viewed from \\\\nbelow.  The owner may wish to maintain the architectural appearance, therefore, roofing nail penetrations of the underside \\\\nof the decking may not be acceptable.  The Florida Building Code provides the option of maintaining this appearance. \\\\n \\\\n______5. Ponding Water: The current roof system and/or deck of the building may not drain well and may cause water to \\\\npond (accumulate) in low lying areas of the roof.  Ponding can be an indication of structural distress and may require the \\\\nreview of a professional structural engineer.  Ponding may shorten the life expectancy and performance of the new roofing \\\\nsystem.  Ponding conditions may not be evident until the original roofing system is removed.  Ponding conditions should be \\\\ncorrected. \\\\n \\\\n______6. Overflow scuppers (wall outlets): It is required that rainwater flows off so that the roof is not overloaded from a \\\\nbuild up of water.  Perimeter/edge walls or other roof extensions may block this discharge if overflow scuppers (wall outlets) \\\\nare not provided.  It may be necessary to install overflow scuppers in accordance with the Florida Building Code, Plumbing. \\\\n \\\\n______7. Ventilation: Most roof structures should have some ability to vent natural airflow through the interior of the \\\\nstructural assembly (the building itself).  The existing amount of attic ventilation shall not be reduced.  It may be beneficial to \\\\nconsider additional venting which can result in extending the service life of the roof. \\\\n \\\\n_________________________ \\\\n              ______/______/______                ________________________ \\\\n \\\\nOwner’s/Agent’s Signature \\\\n          Date \\\\n                              Contractor’s Signature\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\n'}\",\n",

The owner’s initials in the designated space indicates that the item has been explained. \\\\n1. Aesthetics-workmanship: The workmanship provisions of Chapter 15 (High Velocity Hurricane Zone) are for the purpose of \\\\n❏ providing that the roofing system meets the wind resistance and water intrusion performance standards. Aesthetics \\\\n(appearance) are not a consideration with respect to workmanship provisions. Aesthetic issues such as color or architectural \\\\nappearance, that are not part of a zoning code, should be addressed as part of the agreement between the owner and the \\\\ncontractor. \\\\n2. Renailing wood decks: When replacing roofing, the existing wood roof deck may have to be renailed in accordance with \\\\n❏ the current provisions of Chapter 16 (HighVelocity Hurricane Zones) of the Florida Building Code. (The roof deck is usually \\\\nconcealed prior to removing the existing roofsystem). \\\\n❏3. Common roofs: Common roofs are those which have no visible delineation between neighboring units (i.e. \\\\ntownhouses,condominiums,etc.).Inbuildingswithcommonroofs, the roofing contractor and/orowner should notify \\\\nthe occupants of adjacent units of roofing work to be performed. \\\\n❏4. Exposed ceilings: Exposed, open beam ceilings are where the underside of the roof decking can be viewed from below. \\\\nThe owner may wish to maintain the architectural appearance; therefore, roofing nail penetrations of the underside of the \\\\ndecking may not be acceptable. The owner provides the option of maintaining this appearance. \\\\n❏5. Ponding water: The current roof system and/or deck of the building may not drain well and may cause wa- ter to pond \\\\n(accumulate) in low-lying areas of the roof. Ponding can be an indication of structural distress and may require the review of \\\\na professional structural engineer. Ponding may shorten the life expectancy and performance of the new roofing system. \\\\nPonding conditions may not be evident until the original roofing system is removed. Ponding conditions should be \\\\ncorrected. \\\\n6. Overflow scuppers (wall outlets): It is required that rainwater flow off so that the roof is not overloaded from a buildup of \\\\n❏ water. Perimeter/edge walls or other roof extensions may block this discharge if overflow scuppers (wall outlets) are not \\\\nprovided. It may be necessary to install overflow scuppers in accordance with the requirements of: Chapter 15 and 16 \\\\nherein and the Florida Building Code, Plumbing. \\\\n❏7. Ventilation: Most roof structures should have some ability to vent natural airflow through the interior of the structural \\\\nassembly (the building itself). The existing amount of attic ventilation shall not be reduced. \\\\n❏ \\\\n8. Existing Solar Systems: The re-installation of an existing roof mounted photovoltaic system requires a separate permit. \\\\nPermit must be obtained in order to finalize the roofingpermit. \\\\nOWNER’S/AGEN’TS SIGNATURE \\\\nDATE \\\\nCONTRACTOR’S SIGNATURE \\\\nPERMIT NUMBER \\\\nPROPERTY ADDRESS \\\\nSTATE \\\\nZIP \\\\nRevised 1/2024 \\\\n12645 Pinecrest Parkway, Pinecrest, Florida 33156 | T: 305.234.2121 | F: 305.234.2133 | www.pinecrest-fl.gov \\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\n'}\",\n",

       " \"{'page_1': 'MIAMI-DADE COUNTY\\\\nREQUIRED OWNERS NOTIFICATION FOR \\\\n ROOFING CONSIDERATIONS\\\\nIt is the responsibility of the roofing contractor to provide the owner with the required roofing permit, and to ex-\\\\nplain to the owner the content of this form. The owner’s initials in the designated space indicates that the item has \\\\nbeen explained.\\\\n❏ \\\\x07\\\\n1.\\\\t\\\\x07\\\\nAesthetics-workmanship: The workmanship provisions of Chapter 15 (High Velocity Hurricane Zone) are \\\\nfor the purpose of providing that the roofing system meets the wind resistance and water intrusion perfor-\\\\nmance standards. Aesthetics (appearance) are not a consideration with respect to workmanship provisions. \\\\nAesthetic issues such as color or architectural appearance, that are not part of a zoning code, should be \\\\naddressed as part of the agreement between the owner and the contractor.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n❏ \\\\x07\\\\n2.\\\\t \\\\x07\\\\nRenailing wood decks: When replacing roofing, the existing wood roof deck may have to be renailed in \\\\naccordance with the current provisions of Chapter 16 (High Velocity Hurricane Zones) of the Florida Building \\\\nCode. (The roof deck is usually concealed prior to removing the existing roof system).\\\\n\\\\x07❏ \\\\x07\\\\n3.\\\\t \\\\x07\\\\nCommon roofs: Common roofs are those which have no visible delineation between neighboring units \\\\n(i.e. townhouses, condominiums, etc.). In buildings with common roofs, the roofing contractor and/or owner \\\\nshould notify the occupants of adjacent units of roofing work to be performed.\\\\n❏ \\\\x07\\\\n4.\\\\t \\\\x07\\\\nExposed ceilings: Exposed, open beam ceilings are where the underside of the roof decking can be \\\\nviewed from below. The owner may wish to maintain the architectural appearance; therefore, roofing nail \\\\n\\\\xad\\\\npenetrations of the \\\\xad\\\\nunderside of the decking may not be acceptable. The owner provides the option of maintaining \\\\nthis appearance.\\\\n\\\\x07❏ \\\\x07\\\\n5.\\\\t \\\\x07\\\\nPonding water: The current roof system and/or deck of the building may not drain well and may cause wa-\\\\nter to pond (accumulate) in low-lying areas of the roof. Ponding can be an indication of structural distress \\\\nand may require the review of a professional structural engineer. Ponding may shorten the life expectancy \\\\nand performance of the new roofing system. Ponding conditions may not be evident until the original roofing \\\\nsystem is removed. Ponding \\\\xad\\\\nconditions should be corrected.\\\\n❏ \\\\x07\\\\n6. \\\\t\\\\x07\\\\nOverflow scuppers (wall outlets): It is required that rainwater flow off so that the roof is not overloaded \\\\nfrom a build up of water. Perimeter/edge walls or other roof extensions may block this discharge if overflow \\\\nscuppers (wall outlets) are not provided. It may be necessary to install overflow scuppers in accordance \\\\nwith the requirements of: Chapter 15 and 16 herein and the Florida Building Code, Plumbing.\\\\n❏ 7. \\\\x07\\\\nVentilation: Most roof structures should have some ability to vent natural airflow through the interior of the \\\\nstructural assembly (the building itself). The existing amount of attic ventilation shall not be reduced.\\\\n❏ 8. \\\\x07\\\\nExisting Solar Systems: The re-installation of an existing roof mounted photovoltaic system requires a \\\\n\\\\xad\\\\nseparate permit. Permit must be obtained in order to finalize the roofing permit.\\\\n \\\\nCONTRACTOR’S SIGNATURE\\\\nPERMIT NUMBER\\\\nPROPERTY ADDRESS\\\\nSTATE\\\\nZIP\\\\nOWNER’S\\\\u2009\\\\n/AGEN’TS SIGNATURE\\\\nDATE\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\n'}\",\n",

As it pertains to the section, it is the responsibility of roofing contractor to \\\\nprovide the owner with the required roofing permit, and to explain to the owner the content \\\\nof the section. The provisions of Section R4402 govern the minimum requirements and \\\\nstandards of the industry for roofing system installations. Additionally, the following items \\\\nshould be addressed as part of the agreement between the owner ant the contractor. The \\\\nowner’s initial in the designated space indicates that the item has been explained. \\\\n \\\\n1. __________ Aesthetics-Workmanship: the workmanship provisions of Section R4402 are \\\\nfor the purpose of providing that the roof system meets the wind resistance and water \\\\ninstruction performance standards. Aesthetics (appearance) are not a consideration with \\\\nrespect to workmanship provisions. Aesthetic issues such as color or architectural \\\\nappearance, that are not part of a zoning code, should be addressed as part of the \\\\nagreement between the owner and the contractor.  \\\\n \\\\n2. ___________Renailing wood decks: When replacing roofing, the existing wood roof deck \\\\nmay have to be renailed in accordance with the current provisions of Section R4403. (The \\\\nroof deck is usually concealed prior to removing the existing roof system). \\\\n \\\\n3. __________Common roofs: Common roofs are those which have no visible delineation \\\\nbetween neighboring units (i.e., townhouses, condominiums, etc.) In buildings with \\\\ncommon roofs, the roofing contractor and/or owner should notify the occupants of \\\\nadjacent units of roofing to be performed. \\\\n \\\\n4. __________Exposed Ceiling: Exposed, open beam ceilings are where the underside of the \\\\nroof decking can be viewed from below. The owner may wish to maintain the architectural \\\\nappearance; therefore, roofing nail penetration of the underside of the decking may not be \\\\nacceptable. This provides the option of maintaining the appearance. \\\\n \\\\n5. __________Ponding water: The current roof system and/or deck of the building may not \\\\ndrain well and may cause water to pond (accumulate) in low-lying areas of the roof. \\\\nPounding can be an indication of structural distress and may require the review of a \\\\nprofessional structural engineer. Pounding may shorten the life expectancy and \\\\nperformance of the new roofing system. Pounding conditions may not be evident until the \\\\noriginal roofing system is removed. Pounding conditions should be corrected. \\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\n', 'page_2': 'Miami Shores Village - BUILDING DEPARTMENT \\\\n10050 NE 2 Ave Miami Shores, FL 33138 \\\\n305-795-2204  www.msvfl.gov \\\\n       \\\\nRev01142021 \\\\nOwners roofing consideration \\\\nPage 2 of 2 \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n6. __________Overflow scuppers (wall outlets): It is required that rainwater flows off so that \\\\nthe roof is not overloaded from a buildup of water. Perimeter/edge wall or other roof \\\\nextension may block this discharge if overflow scuppers (wall outlets) are not provided. It \\\\nmay be necessary to install overflow scuppers in accordance with the requirements of \\\\nSections R4402, R4403 and R4413. \\\\n \\\\n7. __________Ventilation: Most roof structures should have some ability to vent natural \\\\nairflow through the interior of the structure assembly (the building itself). The existing \\\\namount of attic ventilation shall not be reduced. It may be beneficial to consider additional \\\\nventing which can result in extending the service life of the roof.  \\\\n \\\\n________________________________ \\\\n \\\\n___________________________________ \\\\n Owner/Agent’s Signature \\\\n   Date  \\\\n \\\\nContractor Signature  \\\\n \\\\n      Date \\\\n \\\\nFor Forms and Applications click here:  \\\\nhttp://bldg.miamishoresvillage.com/WebLink/Browse.aspx?id=118080&dbid=0&repo=Mia\\\\nmiShoresVillage \\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\n'}\",\n",

Under Florida\\'s law, those who work on your property or \\\\nprovide materials and are not paid have a right to enforce their claim for payment against your property. \\\\nThis claim is known as a construction lien. \\\\nYOU MUST FILE A NOTICE OF COMMENCEMENT \\\\nFor your protection under the Construction Lien Law and to avoid the possibility of paying twice for \\\\nimprovements to real property, the owner or authorized agent (lender or attorney) shall record a Notice of \\\\nCommencement in the Clerk of the Courts of the Court\\'s office and post a certified copy of the recorded \\\\ndocument at the construction site. The Notice of Commencement must be signed by the owner contacting \\\\nthe improvements and not an agent. \\\\nThe Notice of \\\\nCommencement must substantially contain the information shown on the attached form and \\\\nbe recorded within 90 days before starting the work. \\\\nA copy of a payment bond given by the contractor must be attached as part of the Notice to \\\\nCommencement when recorded. \\\\nIf improvements described in the Notice of Commencement are not actually commenced within 90 days \\\\nafter its recording, the Notice is void and a new Notice of Commencement must be recorded and posted. \\\\nThe owner loses the proper payment defense under the Construction Lien Law if payments are made after \\\\nthe expiration of the Notice of Commencement, which is one year after the recording date or the later \\\\nexpiration date otherwise specified in the Notice of Commencement. \\\\nFlorida law requires the building department to be a second source of information concerning the \\\\nimprovements made on real property. Attached is a copy of our permit application which requires \\\\ninformation on the construction lender and contractor\\'s surety if any. The application also requires the \\\\nsignature of the property owner. This is to help infonn owners of \\\\nthe Construction Lien Law. \\\\nYOU MUST POST THE NOTICE OF COMMENCEMENT AT THE JOB SITE \\\\nBy law, the Building and Zoning Department is required to verify at the first inspection, which occurs 7 \\\\ndays after the building permit is issued, that a certified copy of the recorded Notice of Commencement, \\\\nwith attached bonds if required, is posted at the construction site. Failure to post the Notice will result in a \\\\ndisapproved inspection (F.S. 713.135(l)(d)). \\\\nNOTICE TO OWNER FROM SUBCONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS \\\\nOwners may receive Notice to Owner from subcontractors and material suppliers. This notice advises the \\\\nowner that the sender is providing services or materials and that a written release of lien must be obtained \\\\nfrom the sender before paying the contractor. \\\\nSubcontractors and suppliers must serve a Notice to Owner within 45 days of commencing work to \\\\npreserve their ability to lien you property. Any subcontractor or supplier not serving the owner with a \\\\nNotice to Owner within 45 days of commencing work is not entitled to construction lien. If the address \\\\nfor the owner changes from that given in the Notice of Commencement, the owner should record an \\\\namendment Notice of Commencement reflecting the proper current address ofthe owner. \\\\n\"}',\n",

The owner’s initials in the designated space indicates that the item has \\\\nbeen explained.\\\\n❏ \\\\x07\\\\n1.\\\\t\\\\x07\\\\nAesthetics-workmanship: The workmanship provisions of Chapter 15 (High Velocity Hurricane Zone) are \\\\nfor the purpose of providing that the roofing system meets the wind resistance and water intrusion perfor-\\\\nmance standards. Aesthetics (appearance) are not a consideration with respect to workmanship provisions. \\\\nAesthetic issues such as color or architectural appearance, that are not part of a zoning code, should be \\\\naddressed as part of the agreement between the owner and the contractor.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n\\\\t\\\\n❏ \\\\x07\\\\n2.\\\\t \\\\x07\\\\nRenailing wood decks: When replacing roofing, the existing wood roof deck may have to be renailed in \\\\naccordance with the current provisions of Chapter 16 (High Velocity Hurricane Zones) of the Florida Building \\\\nCode. (The roof deck is usually concealed prior to removing the existing roof system).\\\\n\\\\x07❏ \\\\x07\\\\n3.\\\\t \\\\x07\\\\nCommon roofs: Common roofs are those which have no visible delineation between neighboring units \\\\n(i.e. townhouses, condominiums, etc.). In buildings with common roofs, the roofing contractor and/or owner \\\\nshould notify the occupants of adjacent units of roofing work to be performed.\\\\n❏ \\\\x07\\\\n4.\\\\t \\\\x07\\\\nExposed ceilings: Exposed, open beam ceilings are where the underside of the roof decking can be \\\\nviewed from below. The owner may wish to maintain the architectural appearance; therefore, roofing nail \\\\n\\\\xad\\\\npenetrations of the \\\\xad\\\\nunderside of the decking may not be acceptable. The owner provides the option of maintaining \\\\nthis appearance.\\\\n\\\\x07❏ \\\\x07\\\\n5.\\\\t \\\\x07\\\\nPonding water: The current roof system and/or deck of the building may not drain well and may cause wa-\\\\nter to pond (accumulate) in low-lying areas of the roof. Ponding can be an indication of structural distress \\\\nand may require the review of a professional structural engineer. Ponding may shorten the life expectancy \\\\nand performance of the new roofing system. Ponding conditions may not be evident until the original roofing \\\\nsystem is removed. Ponding \\\\xad\\\\nconditions should be corrected.\\\\n❏ \\\\x07\\\\n6. \\\\t\\\\x07\\\\nOverflow scuppers (wall outlets): It is required that rainwater flow off so that the roof is not overloaded \\\\nfrom a build up of water. Perimeter/edge walls or other roof extensions may block this discharge if overflow \\\\nscuppers (wall outlets) are not provided. It may be necessary to install overflow scuppers in accordance \\\\nwith the requirements of: Chapter 15 and 16 herein and the Florida Building Code, Plumbing.\\\\n❏ 7. \\\\x07\\\\nVentilation: Most roof structures should have some ability to vent natural airflow through the interior of the \\\\nstructural assembly (the building itself). The existing amount of attic ventilation shall not be reduced.\\\\n❏ 8. \\\\x07\\\\nExisting Solar Systems: The re-installation of an existing roof mounted photovoltaic system requires a \\\\n\\\\xad\\\\nseparate permit.

       " \"{'page_1': 'Section 1524 \\\\n \\\\nHigh Velocity Hurricane Zones-Required Owners Notification for Roofing Considerations \\\\n \\\\n1524.1 Scope. As it pertains to this section, it is the responsibility of the roofing contractor to provide the owner with the \\\\nrequired roofing permit, and to explain to the owner the content of this section. The provisions of Chapter 15 of the \\\\nFlorida Building Code, Building govern the minimum requirements and standards of the industry for roofing system \\\\ninstallations. Additionally, the following items should be addressed as part of the agreement between the owner and the \\\\ncontractor. The owner’s initial in the designated space indicates that the item has been explained. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n1. Aesthetics-workmanship: The workmanship provisions of Chapter 15 (High Velocity Hurricane Zone) \\\\nare for the purpose of providing that the roofing system meets the wind resistance and water intrusion \\\\nperformance standards. Aesthetics (appearance) are not a consideration with respect to workmanship \\\\nprovisions. Aesthetic issues such as color or architectural appearance, that are not part of a zoning code, \\\\nshould be addressed as part of the agreement between the owner and the contractor. \\\\n \\\\n2. Renailing wood decks: When replacing roofing, the existing wood roof deck may have to be renailed in \\\\naccordance with the current provisions of Chapter 16 (High Velocity Hurricane Zones) of the Florida \\\\nBuilding Code. (The roof deck is usually concealed prior to removing the existing roof system). \\\\n \\\\n3. Common roofs: Common roofs are those which have no visible delineation between neighboring units \\\\n(i.e. townhouses, condominiums, etc.). In buildings with common roofs, the roofing contractor and/or \\\\nowner should notify the occupants of adjacent units of roofing work to be performed. \\\\n \\\\n4. \\\\nExposed ceilings: Exposed, open beam ceilings are where the underside of the roof decking can be \\\\nviewed from below. The owner may wish to maintain the architectural appearance; therefore, roofing \\\\nnail penetrations of the underside of the decking may not be acceptable. The owner provides the option \\\\nof maintaining this appearance.  \\\\n \\\\n5. Ponding water: The current roof system and/or deck of the building may not drain well and may cause \\\\nwater to pond (accumulate) in low-lying areas of the roof. Ponding can be an indication of structural \\\\ndistress and may require the review of a professional structural engineer. Ponding may shorten the life \\\\nexpectancy and performance of the new roofing system. Ponding conditions may not be evident until the \\\\noriginal roofing system is removed. Ponding conditions should be corrected. \\\\n \\\\n6. Overflow scuppers (wall outlets): It is required that rainwater flow off so that the roof is not \\\\noverloaded from a buildup of water. Perimeter/edge walls or other roof extensions may block this \\\\ndischarge if overflow scuppers (wall outlets) are not provided. It may be necessary to install overflow \\\\nscuppers in accordance with the requirements of: Chapter 15 and 16 herein and the Florida Building \\\\nCode, Plumbing. \\\\n \\\\n7. Ventilation: Most roof structures should have some ability to vent natural airflow through the interior of \\\\nthe structural assembly (the building itself). The existing amount of attic ventilation shall not be reduced. \\\\nExemption: Attic spaces, designed by a Florida-licensed engineer or registered architect to eliminate the \\\\nattic venting, venting shall not be required. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nProperty Address:  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n__________________________________ \\\\n_  \\\\nPermit No.: __________________ \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nOwner’s/Agent’s Signature:  \\\\n___________________________________  \\\\nDate:  \\\\n \\\\n__________________ \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nContractor’s Signature: \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n__________________________________ \\\\n__  \\\\nDate:  \\\\n \\\\n__________________ \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nRevised 1.26.15 \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\n'}\",\n",

This \\\\nnotice must be signed by you, the property owner. \\\\n     Under Florida law, those who work on your property or provide \\\\nmaterials and are not paid, have a right to enforce their claim for \\\\npayment against your property. This claim is known as a construction \\\\nlien. \\\\nYOU MUST FILE A NOTICE OF \\\\nCOMMENCEMENT \\\\n     For your protection under the Construction Lien Law and to avoid \\\\nthe possibility of paying twice for improvements to real property, you \\\\nmust record a Notice of Commencement in the Clerk of the Court’s \\\\nOffice. You also must provide a certified copy of the recorded \\\\ndocument at the construction site. The Notice of Commencement must \\\\nbe signed by you, the owner contracting the improvements, and not by \\\\nyour agent. \\\\n     The Notice of Commencement form, provided with this \\\\ninformation packet, must be completed and recorded within 90 days \\\\nbefore starting the work. \\\\n     A copy of the payment bond, if any is required by you and \\\\npurchased by the contractor, must be attached as part of the Notice of \\\\nCommencement when recorded. \\\\n     If improvements described in the Notice of Commencement are not \\\\nactually started within 90 days after the recording of the Notice, a new \\\\nNotice of Commencement must be recorded. You lose your protection \\\\nunder the Construction Lien Law if the payments are made to the \\\\ncontractor after the expiration of the Notice of Commencement. The \\\\nNotice is good for one year after the recording date or up to the date \\\\nspecified under item nine of the form. \\\\n     Florida law requires the City of Aventura to be a second source of \\\\ninformation concerning the improvements made on real property. The \\\\nBuilding Permit Application (included with this packet) has been \\\\nexpanded to include information on the construction lender and the \\\\ncontractor’s surety, if any. The new application requires your signature \\\\nor your agent’s, to inform you of the Construction Lien Law. \\\\nYOU MUST SUBMIT THE NOTICE OF \\\\nCOMMENCEMENT \\\\nBy law, no inspections for work will be scheduled until a \\\\nCertified Recorded copy of the Notice of Commencement is \\\\nreceived by the City of Aventura Building Division and is \\\\nposted at the construction site. (Florida Statute 713.135(1)(d)).\\\\nYou \\\\nmay \\\\nreceive \\\\na \\\\nNotice \\\\nto \\\\nOwner \\\\nfrom \\\\nsubcontractors and material suppliers. This notice advises you that\\\\nthe sender is providing services or materials. Subcontractors and \\\\nsuppliers must serve a Notice to Owner within 45 days of commencing \\\\nwork to preserve their ability to lien your property. \\\\n     If your address changes from that given in the Notice of \\\\nCommencement, you should record a corrected Notice reflecting your \\\\ncurrent address. This is done to help ensure you will receive all notices. \\\\nRELEASE FROM LIEN FROM CONTRACTOR \\\\n     Prior to paying the contractor, you need to receive a Release of Lien \\\\nand Affidavit to the extent of payment from the general contractor. The \\\\nRelease of Lien and Affidavit shall state either that all the \\\\nsubcontractors and suppliers have been paid or list those unpaid and the \\\\namount owed. The contractor is required to list on the Release of Lien \\\\nand Affidavit any subcontractor or supplier that has not been paid. That \\\\namount may be withheld from the contractor’s pay and paid directly to \\\\nthe subcontractor or suppliers after 10 days written notice to the \\\\ncontractor. \\\\n     If the balance due to the contractor is not sufficient to pay in full all \\\\nsubcontractors and suppliers listed on the contractor’s affidavit, you \\\\nmay wish to consult an attorney. \\\\n     The general contractor shall furnish a final Release of Lien and \\\\nAffidavit to the owner indicating all subcontractors and suppliers have \\\\nbeen paid at the time he requests final payment. You can rely on the \\\\naffidavit in making final payment to the general contractor. If you make \\\\nfinal payment to the general contractor without obtaining the affidavit, \\\\nyour property can be liened for non-payment if the general contractor \\\\nfails to pay the subcontractors or suppliers. You should always obtain a \\\\nRelease of Lien and Affidavit from the contractor to the extent of \\\\nany payments being made. \\\\nRELY ON YOUR LENDER FOR COMPLIANCE \\\\n    If you have a lender, you may rely on the lender to handle \\\\nthe recording of the Notice of Commencement. Learn more about \\\\nthe Construction Lien Law by contacting an attorney, your lender, or \\\\nthe Florida Department of Agricultural and Consumer Services, \\\\nDivision of Consumer Services. \\\\nDocuments are recorded at the Clerk of the Courts, \\\\nMIAMI-DADE  COUNTY RECORDER \\\\nCOURTHOUSE EAST \\\\n22 N.W. First Street \\\\n1st Floor \\\\nMiami, FL 33128. \\\\n    You can record the Notice of Commencement by mail. The original \\\\nNotice should be sent to the County Recorder, P.O. Box 011711, \\\\nFlagler Station, Miami, Florida 33101. Please make sure the original \\\\nNotice is signed and notarized. Also, remember to enclose the \\\\nrecording fee (for a single copy) and written instructions for recording \\\\nand returning a certified copy of the recorded documents.

If no permit is obtained, do not allow the work to start. \\\\n \\\\nNotice of Commencement  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 \\\\nFor your protection under the Construction Lien Law and to avoid the possibility of paying twice for improvements to real \\\\nproperty, you must record a Notice of Commencement in the Clerk of the Court’s Office. \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 \\\\nThe Notice of Commencement must be signed by the owner contracting the improvement, and not your agent. \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 \\\\nFlorida’s Construction Lien Law (Chapter 713, Part One, Florida Statutes) requires the recording of a Notice of Commencement \\\\nwith the Clerk of the Courts for real property improvements greater than $2,500. \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 \\\\nUnder Florida law, those who work on your property or provide materials and are not paid, have a right to enforce their claim for \\\\npayment against your property. This claim is known as a construction lien. \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 \\\\nThe Notice of Commencement must be completed and recorded within 90 days before starting the work.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 \\\\nA copy is also to be posted on the job site. \\\\n \\\\nFor Additional information visit the following links: \\\\n \\\\nwww.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=View%20Statutes&SubMenu=1&App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=building+permit&URL=07\\\\n00-0799/0713/Sections/0713.135.html \\\\n \\\\nwww.myfloridalicense.com/dbpr/pro/cilb/documents/florida_lien_law.pdf \\\\n \\\\nLicensed contractors \\\\nThere are two types of contractor’s license, one issued by Miami-Dade County and one by the State of Florida.  The Miami-Dade County \\\\nPermitting, Environmental and Regulatory Affairs (PERA) regulates Miami-Dade licensed contractors (see Chapter 10 of the Code of \\\\nMiami-Dade County).  The State of Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulations (DBPR) regulates the State licensed \\\\ncontractors (see Chapter 489 of the Florida Statutes).

       " '{\\'page_1\\': \"SECTION 1524 \\\\nHIGH VELOCITY HURRICANE ZONES-- REQUIRED OWNERS NOTIFICATION FOR \\\\nROOFING CONSIDERATIONS \\\\n1524.1 Scope. As it pertains to this section, it is the responsibility of the roofing contractor to provide the owner \\\\nwith the required roofing permit, and to explain to the owner the content of this section. The provisions of \\\\nChapter 15 of the Florida Building Code, Building govern the minimum requirements and standards of the \\\\nindustry for roofing system installations. Additionally, the following items should be addressed as part of the \\\\nagreement between the owner and the contractor. The owner\\'s initial in the designated space indicates that the \\\\nitem has been explained. \\\\n1. Aesthetics-workmanship: The workmanship provisions of Chapter 15 (High Velocity Hurricane\\\\nZone) are for the purpose of providing that the roofing system meets the wind resistance and water intrusion \\\\nperformance standards. Aesthetics (appearance) are not a consideration with respect to workmanship provisions.  \\\\nAesthetic issues such as color or architectural appearance, that are not part of a zoning code, should be \\\\naddressed as part of the agreement between the owner and the contractor. \\\\n2. Renailing wood decks: When replacing roofing, the existing wood roof deck may have to be\\\\nrenailed in accordance with the current provisions of Chapter 16 (High Velocity Hurricane Zones) of the Florida \\\\nBuilding Code. (The roof deck is usually concealed prior to removing the existing roof system). \\\\n3. Common roofs: Common roofs are those which have no visible delineation between neighboring\\\\nunits (i.e. townhouses, condominiums, etc.). In buildings with common roofs, the roofing contractor and/or \\\\nowner should notify the occupants of adjacent units of roofing work to be performed. \\\\n4. Exposed ceilings: Exposed, open beam ceilings are where the underside of the roof decking can be\\\\nviewed from below. The owner may wish to maintain the architectural appearance; therefore, roofing nail \\\\npenetrations of the underside of the decking may not be acceptable. The owner provides the option of \\\\nmaintaining this appearance. \\\\n5. Ponding water: The current roof system and/or deck of the building may not drain well and may\\\\ncause water to pond (accumulate) in low-lying areas of the roof. Ponding can be an indication of structural \\\\ndistress and may require the review of a professional structural engineer. Ponding may shorten the life \\\\nexpectancy and performance of the new roofing system. Ponding conditions may not be evident until the \\\\noriginal roofing system is removed. Ponding conditions should be corrected. \\\\n6. Overflow scuppers (wall outlets): It is required that rainwater flows off so that the roof is not\\\\noverloaded from a buildup of water. Perimeter/edge walls or other roof extensions may block this discharge if \\\\noverflow scuppers (wall outlets) are not provided.

As it pertains to this section, it is the responsibility of the roofing contractor to provide the\\\\nowner with the required roofing permit, and to explain to the owner the content of this section. The provisions of\\\\nChapter 15 of the Florida Building Code, Building govern the minimum requirements and standards of the industry\\\\nfor roofing system installations. Additionally, the following items should be addressed as part of the agreement\\\\nbetween the owner and the contractor. The owner\\'s initial in the designated space indicates that the item has been\\\\nexplained.\\\\n1. Aesthetics-Workmanship: The workmanship provisions of Chapter 15 (High Velocity Hurricane\\\\nZone) are for the purpose of providing that the roofing system meets the wind resistance and water intrusion \\\\nperformance standards. Aesthetics (appearance) are not a consideration with respect to workmanship provisions. \\\\nAesthetic issues such as color or architectural appearance, that are not part of a zoning code, should be \\\\naddressed as part of the agreement between the owner and the contractor. \\\\n \\\\n2. Renailing Wood Decks: When replacing roofing, the existing wood roof deck may have to be\\\\nrenailed in accordance with the current provisions of Chapter 16 (High Velocity Hurricane Zones) of the Florida \\\\nBuilding Code, Building. (The roof deck is usually concealed prior to removing the existing roof system). \\\\n3. Common Roofs: Common roofs are those which have no visible delineation between neighboring\\\\nunits (i.e., townhouses, condominiums, etc.). In buildings with common roofs, the roofing contractor and/or owner \\\\nshould notify the occupants of adjacent units of roofing work to be performed. \\\\n 4. Exposed ceilings: Exposed, open beam ceilings are where the underside of the roof decking can be\\\\nviewed from below. The owner may wish to maintain the architectural appearance; therefore, roofing nail \\\\npenetrations of the underside of the decking may not be acceptable. The provides the option of maintaining this \\\\nappearance. \\\\n5. Ponding Water: The current roof system and/or deck of the building may not drain well and may\\\\ncause water to pond (accumulate) in low-lying areas of the roof. Ponding can be an indication of structural distress \\\\nand may require the review of a professional structural engineer. Ponding may shorten the life expectancy and \\\\nperformance of the new roofing system. Ponding conditions may not be evident until the original roofing system is \\\\nremoved. Ponding conditions should be corrected. \\\\n6. Overflow Scuppers (wall outlets): It is required that rainwater flow off so that the roof is not\\\\noverloaded from a buildup of water. Perimeter/edge walls or other roof extensions may block this discharge if \\\\noverflow scuppers (wall outlets) are not provided. It may be necessary to install overflow scuppers in accordance \\\\nwith the requirements of Chapter 15 and 16 herein and the Florida Building Code, Plumbing. \\\\n \\\\n7. Ventilation: Most roof structures should have some ability to vent natural airflow through the interior\\\\nof the structural assembly (the building itself). The existing amount of attic ventilation shall not be reduced. It may \\\\nbe beneficial to consider additional venting which can result in extending the service life of the roof. \\\\nOwner\\'s/Agent\\'s Signature \\\\nDate \\\\nContractor\\'s Signature \\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\n\"}',\n",

Please include a copy of your state-issued driver’s license. \\\\n \\\\nI am applying for a Building Permit pursuant to the Owner/Builder exemption set forth in Florida Statute 489.103. Florida \\\\nlaw requires that I attest to the following statements. \\\\n \\\\nBY SIGNING THIS STATEMENT, I ATTEST THAT: (Initial to the left of each statement) \\\\n \\\\uf0ff\\\\n \\\\nI understand that state law requires construction to be done by a licensed contractor and have applied for an \\\\nowner/builder permit under an exemption from the law. The exemption specifies that I, as the owner of the property \\\\nlisted, may act as my own contractor with certain restrictions even though I do not have a license. \\\\n \\\\uf0ff\\\\n \\\\nI understand that building permits are not required to be signed by a property owner unless he or she is responsible for \\\\nthe construction and is not hiring a licensed contractor to assume responsibility. \\\\n \\\\uf0ff\\\\n \\\\nI understand that, as an owner/builder, I am the responsible party of record on this permit. I understand that I may \\\\nprotect myself from potential financial risk by hiring a licensed contractor and having the permit filed in his or her \\\\nname instead of my own name. I also understand that a contractor is required by law to be licensed in Florida and \\\\nto list his or her license numbers on all permit and contracts. \\\\n \\\\uf0ff\\\\n \\\\nI understand that I may build or improve a one-family or two-family residence or a farm outbuilding. I may also \\\\nbuild or improve a commercial building if the costs do not exceed $75,000. The building or residence must be \\\\nfor my own use or occupancy. It may not be built or substantially improved for sale or lease. If a building or \\\\nresidence that I have built or substantially improved myself is sold or leased within 1 year after the \\\\nconstruction is complete, the law will presume that I built or substantially improved it for sale or lease, which \\\\nviolates this exemption. Florida State Statute 489.103(7), 489.503(6)  \\\\n \\\\uf0ff\\\\n \\\\nI understand that, as the owner/builder, I must provide direct, onsite supervision of the construction. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\uf0ff\\\\n \\\\nI understand that I may not hire an unlicensed individual person to act as my contractor or to supervise persons \\\\nworking on my building or residence. It is my responsibility to ensure that the persons whom I employ have the \\\\nlicenses required by law and by county ordinance. \\\\n \\\\uf0ff\\\\n \\\\nI understand that it is a frequent practice of unlicensed persons to have the property owner obtain an \\\\nowner/builder permit that erroneously implies that the property owner is providing his or her own labor and \\\\nmaterials. I, as an owner/builder, may be held liable and subjected to serious financial risk for any injuries \\\\nsustained by an unlicensed person or his or her employees while working on my property. My homeowner\\'s \\\\ninsurance may not provide coverage for those injuries. I am willfully acting as an owner/builder and am aware of \\\\nthe limits of my insurance coverage for injuries to workers on my property. \\\\n \\\\uf0ff\\\\n \\\\nI understand that I may not delegate the responsibility for supervising work to a licensed contractor who is not \\\\nlicensed to perform the work being done. Any person working on my building who is not licensed must work \\\\nunder my direct supervision and must be employed by me, which means that I must comply with laws requiring \\\\nthe withholding of federal income tax and social security contributions under the Federal Insurance \\\\nContributions Act (FICA) and must provide workers\\' compensation for the employee. I understand that my failure \\\\nto follow these laws may subject me to serious financial risk. \\\\n \\\\n\", \\'page_3\\': \\'Broward County Board of County Commissioners \\\\nBroward.org \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nResilient Environment Department \\\\nBUILDING CODE DIVISION | BUILDING PERMITTING \\\\n2307 West Broward Boulevard, Suite 300 • Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33312 • 954-765-4400 • broward.org/building \\\\n \\\\n \\\\uf0ff\\\\n \\\\nI agree that, as the party legally and financially responsible for this proposed construction activity, 1 will \\\\nabide by all applicable laws and requirements that govern owner/builders as well as employers.

As it pertains to this section, it is the responsibility of the roofing contractor to provide the owner with \\\\nthe required roofing permit, and to explain to the owner the content of this section. The provisions of Chapter 15 of the \\\\nFlorida Building Code, Building govern the minimum requirements and standards of the industry for roofing system \\\\ninstallations. Additionally, the following items should be addressed as part of the agreement between the owner and \\\\nthe contractor. The owner\\'s initial in the designated space indicates that the item has been explained. \\\\n \\\\n______ 1. Aesthetics-Workmanship: The workmanship provisions of Chapter 15 (High Velocity Hurricane Zone) \\\\nare for the purpose of providing that the roofing system meets the wind resistance and water intrusion performance \\\\nstandards. Aesthetics (appearance) are not a consideration with respect to workmanship provisions. Aesthetic issues \\\\nsuch as color or architectural appearance, that are not part of a zoning code, should be addressed as part of the \\\\nagreement between the owner and the contractor. \\\\n \\\\n______ 2. Renailing Wood Decks: When replacing roofing, the existing wood roof deck may have to be renailed in \\\\naccordance with the current provisions of Chapter 16 (High Velocity Hurricane Zones) of the Florida Building Code, \\\\nBuilding. (The roof deck is usually concealed prior to removing the existing roof system). \\\\n \\\\n______ 3. Common Roofs: Common roofs are those which have no visible delineation between neighboring units \\\\n(i.e., townhouses, condominiums, etc.). In buildings with common roofs, the roofing contractor and/or owner should \\\\nnotify the occupants of adjacent units of roofing work to be performed. \\\\n  \\\\n______ 4. Exposed ceilings: Exposed, open beam ceilings are where the underside of the roof decking can be \\\\nviewed from below. The owner may wish to maintain the architectural appearance; therefore, roofing nail penetrations \\\\nof the underside of the decking may not be acceptable. The owner provides the option of maintaining this appearance. \\\\n \\\\n______ 5. Ponding Water: The current roof system and/or deck of the building may not drain well and may cause \\\\nwater to pond (accumulate) in low-lying areas of the roof. Ponding can be an indication of structural distress and may \\\\nrequire the review of a professional structural engineer. Ponding may shorten the life expectancy and performance \\\\nof the new roofing system. Ponding conditions may not be evident until the original roofing system is removed. \\\\nPonding conditions should be corrected. \\\\n \\\\n______ 6. Overflow Scuppers (wall outlets): It is required that rainwater flow off so that the roof is not overloaded \\\\nfrom a buildup of water. Perimeter/edge walls or other roof extensions may block this discharge if overflow scuppers \\\\n(wall outlets) are not provided. It may be necessary to install overflow scuppers in accordance with the requirements \\\\nof Chapter 15 and 16 herein and the Florida Building Code, Plumbing. \\\\n \\\\n______ 7. Ventilation: Most roof structures should have some ability to vent natural airflow through the interior of \\\\nthe structural assembly (the building itself). The existing amount of attic ventilation shall not be reduced. \\\\n \\\\nException: Attic spaces, designed by a Florida licensed engineer or registered architect to eliminate the attic venting, \\\\nventing shall not be required. \\\\n \\\\nCOMMENTS: \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n_______________________________ \\\\n______________ \\\\n_______________________________ \\\\nOwner\\'s/Agent\\'s Signature \\\\nDate            \\\\n \\\\nContractor\\'s Signature \\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\n\"}',\n",

The exemption specifies that I, as the owner of the property listed, may act as my \\\\nown contractor with certain restrictions even though I do not have a license. \\\\n \\\\n2.

I understand that, as an owner-builder, I am the responsible party of record on a permit. I understand that I may protect \\\\nmyself from potential financial risk by hiring a licensed contractor and having the permit filed in his or her name instead of \\\\nmy own name. I also understand that a contractor is required by law to be licensed in Florida and to list his or her license \\\\nnumbers on permits and contracts. \\\\n \\\\n4. I understand that I may build or improve a one-family or two-family residence or a farm outbuilding. I may also build or \\\\nimprove a commercial building if the costs do not exceed $75,000. The building or residence must be for my own use or \\\\noccupancy. It may not be built or substantially improved for sale or lease, unless I am completing the requirements of a \\\\nbuilding permit where the contractor listed on the permit substantially completed the project. If a building or residence that \\\\nI have built or substantially improved myself is sold or leased within 1 year after the construction is complete, the law will \\\\npresume that I built or substantially improved it for sale or lease, which violates the exemption. \\\\n \\\\n5. I understand that, as the owner-builder, I must provide direct, onsite supervision of the construction. \\\\n \\\\n6. I understand that I may not hire an unlicensed person to act as my contractor or to supervise persons working on my building \\\\nor residence. It is my responsibility to ensure that the persons whom I employ have the licenses required by law and by county \\\\nor municipal ordinance. \\\\n \\\\n7. I understand that it is a frequent practice of unlicensed persons to have the property owner obtain an owner-builder permit \\\\nthat erroneously implies that the property owner is providing his or her own labor and materials. I, as an owner-builder, may \\\\nbe held liable and subjected to serious financial risk for any injuries sustained by an unlicensed person or his or her employees \\\\nwhile working on my property. My homeowner’s insurance may not provide coverage for those injuries. I am willfully acting \\\\nas an owner-builder and am aware of the limits of my insurance coverage for injuries to workers on my property. \\\\n \\\\n8. I understand that I may not delegate the responsibility for supervising work to a licensed contractor who is not licensed to \\\\nperform the work being done. Any person working on my building who is not licensed must work under my direct supervision \\\\nand must be employed by me, which means that I must comply with laws requiring the withholding of federal income tax and \\\\nsocial security contributions under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and must provide workers’ compensation \\\\nfor the employee. I understand that my failure to follow these laws may subject me to serious financial risk. \\\\n \\\\n9. I agree that, as the party legally and financially responsible for this proposed construction activity, I will abide by all applicable \\\\nlaws and requirements that govern owner-builders as well as employers. I also understand that the construction must comply \\\\nwith all applicable laws, ordinances, building codes, and zoning regulations. \\\\n \\\\n10. I understand that I may obtain more information regarding my obligations as an employer from the Internal Revenue Service, \\\\nthe United States Small Business Administration, the Florida Department of Financial Services, and the Florida Department \\\\nof Revenue. I also understand that I may contact the Florida Construction Industry Licensing Board at 850-487-1395 or \\\\nhttps://www.myfloridalicense.com and/or Broward County Permitting, Licensing and Consumer Protection Division at 954-\\\\n765-4400, Option 8 or  https://www.broward.org/building for more information about licensed contractors. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n', 'page_2': 'Owner/Builder Affidavit \\\\nPage 2 of 2 \\\\nVer. 2023_1 / Rev. 05/29/2023 \\\\n \\\\n11.

Your only remedy against an unlicensed contractor may be in civil court. It is also important for you to \\\\nunderstand that, if an unlicensed contractor or employee of an individual or firm is injured while working on your property, you \\\\nmay be held liable for damages. If you obtain an owner-builder permit and wish to hire a licensed contractor, you will be \\\\nresponsible for verifying whether the contractor is properly licensed and the status of the contractor’s workers’ compensation \\\\ncoverage. \\\\n \\\\nBefore a building permit can be issued, this disclosure statement must be completed and signed by the property owner and \\\\nreturned to the local permitting agency responsible for issuing the permit.

(The roof deck is usually concealed prior \\\\nto removing the existing roof system.) \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n2. ___________ Exposed Ceilings: Exposed, open beam ceilings are where the underside of the roof decking \\\\ncan be viewed from below. The owner may wish to maintain the architectural appearance; therefore, roofing \\\\nnail penetrations of the underside of the decking may not be acceptable. This provides the option of \\\\nmaintaining this appearance. \\\\n \\\\n3. ___________Overflow scuppers (wall outlets): It is required that rainwater flow off so that the roof is not \\\\noverloaded from a buildup of water. Perimeter/edge walls or other roof extensions may block this discharge \\\\nif overflow scuppers (wall outlets) are not provided. It may be necessary to install overflow scuppers in \\\\naccordance with the requirements of this chapter and Florida Building Code, Plumbing. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n________________________________ \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n__________________________ \\\\nOwner’s Signature \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDate \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n                                                                \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n                                                    \\\\nContractor’s Signature  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDate \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\n'}\",\n",

Florida law requires that I attest to the following statements. BY SIGNING THIS STATEMENT, I \\\\nATTEST THAT:  (Initial to the left of each statement) \\\\n \\\\nI understand that state law requires construction to be done by a licensed contractor and have applied for an \\\\nowner-builder permit under an exemption from the law. The exemption specifies that I, as the owner of the \\\\nproperty listed, may act as my own contractor with certain restrictions even though I do not have a license. \\\\n \\\\nI understand that building permits are not required to be signed by a property owner unless he or she is \\\\nresponsible for the construction and is not hiring a licensed contractor to assume responsibility. \\\\n \\\\nI understand that, as an owner-builder, I am the responsible party of record on a permit. I understand that I \\\\nmay protect myself from potential financial risk by hiring a licensed contractor and having the permit filed in \\\\nhis or her name instead of my own name. I also understand that a contractor is required by law to be licensed \\\\nin Florida and to list his or her license numbers on all permit and contracts. \\\\n \\\\nI understand that I may build or improve a one-family or two-family residence or a farm outbuilding. I may \\\\nalso build or improve a commercial building if the costs do not exceed $75,000. The building or residence \\\\nmust be for my own use or occupancy. It may not be built or substantially improved for sale or lease. If a \\\\nbuilding or residence that I have built or substantially improved myself is sold or leased within in 1 year after \\\\nthe construction is complete, the law will presume that I built or substantially improved it for sale or lease, \\\\nwhich violates this exemption. \\\\n \\\\nI understand that, as the owner-builder, I must provide direct, onsite supervision of the construction. \\\\n \\\\nI understand that I may not hire an unlicensed individual person to act as my contractor or to supervise \\\\npersons working on my building or residence. It is my responsibility to ensure that the persons whom I employ \\\\nhave the licenses required by law and by county ordinance. \\\\n \\\\nI understand that it is frequent practices of unlicensed persons to have the property owner obtain an owner- \\\\nbuilder permit that erroneously implies that the property owner is providing his or her own labor and \\\\nmaterials. I, as an owner-builder, may be held liable and subjected to serious financial risk for any injuries \\\\nsustained by an unlicensed person or his or her employees while working on my property. My homeowner’s \\\\ninsurance may not provide coverage for those injuries. I am willfully acting as an owner-builder and am aware \\\\nof the limits of my insurance coverage for injuries to workers on my property. \\\\nI understand that I may not delegate the responsibility for supervising work to a licensed contractor who is not \\\\nlicensed to perform the work being done. Any person working on my building who Is not licensed must work under \\\\nmy direct supervision and must be employed by me, which means that I must comply with laws requiring the \\\\nwithholding of federal income tax and social security contributions under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act \\\\n(FICA) and must provide workers’ compensation for the employee.

You have applied for a permit under \\\\nexemption to that law. The exemption allows you as the owner of your property, ta act as your own contractor \\\\neven though you do not have a license. You must supervise the construction yourself. You may move, remove or \\\\ndispose of asbestos containing materials on a residential building where you occupy the building and is not for sale \\\\nor lease or the building is a farm outbuilding o your property. If you sell or lease such building within 1 year after \\\\nthe asbestos abatement is complete, the law will presume that you intended to sell or lease the property at the \\\\ntime the work is done, which is a violation of this exception. You may not hire an unlicensed person as your \\\\ncontractor. Your work must be done according to all local, state and federal laws and regulations which apply \\\\nasbestos abatement projects. It is your responsibility to make sure that people employed by you have licensed \\\\nrequired by state law and by county or municipal licensing ordinances. \\\\n \\\\nLicensed contractors are regulated by laws designed to protect the public. If you contract with a person who does \\\\nnot have a license, the Construction Industry Licensing Board, the Department of Business and Professional \\\\nRegulation and the building department may be unable to assist you with any financial loss that you sustain as a \\\\nresult of a complaint. Your only remedy against an unlicensed contractor may be in civil court. It is also important \\\\nfor you to understand that, if an unlicensed contractor or employee of an individual or firm is injured while  working \\\\non your property, you may be held liable for damages. If you obtain an owner-builder permit and wish to hire a \\\\nlicensed contractor, you will be responsible for verifying whether the contractor is property licensed and the status \\\\nof the contractor’s workers’ compensation coverage. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nCheck types of permits you are seeking: \\\\n \\\\nBuilding \\\\n□ Roofing / Reroofing \\\\n□ Electrical \\\\n□ Plumbing \\\\n□ Air Conditioning \\\\nI, \\\\n, do \\\\nhereby state that I am qualified and capable of performing \\\\nthe requested construction involved with the permit \\\\napplication filed and agree to the conditions specified \\\\nabove. \\\\n \\\\nSignature of Owner-Builder \\\\n□ Other  \\\\n_ \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\nSTATE OF FLORIDA – COUNTY OF BROWARD \\\\n \\\\nSworn to (or affirmed) and subscribed before me \\\\nThis \\\\nday of  \\\\n, 20  \\\\n          \\\\nby \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n(Type / Print owners name) \\\\nNOTARY as to owner’s signature \\\\n'}\",\n",

Florida  law  requires  that  I attest  to the  following  statements.  BY SIGNING THIS STATEMENT, I ATTEST \\\\nTHAT: (Initial to the left of each statement) \\\\nI understand that state law requires construction to be done by a licensed contractor and have applied for an owner-builder \\\\npermit under an exemption from the law. The exemption specifies that I, as the owner of the property listed, may act as my \\\\nown contractor with certain restrictions even though I do not have a license. \\\\nI understand that building permits are not required to be signed by a property owner unless he or she is responsible for the \\\\nconstruction and is not hiring a licensed contractor to assume responsibility. \\\\nI understand that, as an owner-builder, I am the responsible party of record on a permit. I understand that I may protect \\\\nmyself from potential financial risk by hiring a licensed contractor and having the permit filed in his or her name instead of \\\\nmy own name. I also understand that a contractor is required by law to be licensed in Florida and to list his or her license \\\\nnumbers on all permit and contracts. \\\\nI understand that I may build or improve a one-family or two-family residence or a farm outbuilding. I may also build or \\\\nimprove a commercial building if the costs do not exceed $75,000. The building or residence must be for my own use or \\\\noccupancy. It may not be built or substantially improved for sale or lease. If a building or residence that I have built or \\\\nsubstantially improved myself is sold or leased within in 1 year after the construction is complete, the law will presume that I \\\\nbuilt or substantially improved it for sale or lease, which violates this exemption. \\\\nI understand that, as the owner-builder, I must provide direct, onsite supervision of the construction. \\\\nI understand that I may not hire an unlicensed individual person to act as my contractor or to supervise persons working on \\\\nmy building or residence. It is my responsibility to ensure that the persons whom I employ have the licenses required by law \\\\nand by county ordinance. \\\\nI understand that it is frequent practices of unlicensed persons to have the property owner obtain an owner-builder permit \\\\nthat erroneously implies that the property owner is providing his or her own labor and materials. I, as an owner-builder, may \\\\nbe held liable and subjected to serious financial risk for any injuries sustained by an unlicensed person or his or her \\\\nemployees while working on my property. My homeowner’s insurance may not provide coverage for those injuries.

As an alternative to an engineered \\\\ndesign, the prescriptive retrofit solutions provided in Section 201.3.1 through 201.3.4 below shall be \\\\naccepted as meeting the mandated roof-to-wall retrofit requirements. \\\\n \\\\n201.3.1 Prescriptive method for gable roofs on a wood frame wall. Sufficient eave sheathing shall \\\\nbe removed to expose a minimum of 6-feet of framing members, measured from the corner, along the \\\\nexterior wall on each side of each gable end. The anchorage of each of the exposed rafters or truss shall \\\\nbe inspected. Wherever a strap is missing or an existing strap has less than 4 fasteners on each end, \\\\napproved straps, ties or right angle gusset brackets with a minimum uplift capacity of 500 lbs. shall be \\\\ninstalled that connect each rafter or truss to the top plate below. Adding fasteners to existing straps shall \\\\nbe allowed in lieu of adding a new strap providing the strap is manufactured to accommodate at least 4 \\\\nfasteners.

Sufficient corner eave sheathing \\\\nshall be removed from the side of the hip ridge parallel to the roof ridge to provide access to a minimum 6- \\\\nfoot length of the exterior wall. The hip ridge board and any exposed rafters that are not anchored with a \\\\nstrap having at least 4 fasteners on each end, shall be connected to the top plate below using a strap or \\\\nright angle gusset bracket having a minimum uplift capacity of 500 lbs. Adding fasteners to existing straps \\\\nshall be allowed in lieu of adding a new strap providing the strap is manufactured to accommodate at least \\\\n4 fasteners.

The hip ridge board and any exposed rafters that are not anchored with a \\\\nstrap having at least 4 fasteners on each end, shall be connected to the concrete wall below using a strap \\\\nor right angle gusset bracket having a minimum uplift capacity of 500 lbs. Adding fasteners to existing \\\\nstraps shall be allowed in lieu of adding a new strap providing the strap is manufactured to accommodate \\\\nat least 4 fasteners at each end. The straps or right angle gusset bracket shall be installed such that they \\\\nconnect each rafter or truss to the top plate below or directly to the masonry wall using approved masonry \\\\nscrews that will provide at least 2 ½ inch embedment into the concrete or masonry.

The owner’s initials in the designated space \\\\nindicates that the item has been explained. \\\\n \\\\n❏ 1. Aesthetics-workmanship: The workmanship provisions of Chapter 15 (High Velocity Hurricane \\\\nZone) are for the purpose of providing that the roofing system meets the wind resistance and water \\\\nintrusion performance standards. Aesthetics (appearance) are not a consideration with respect to \\\\nworkmanship provisions. Aesthetic issues such as color or architectural appearance, that are not part of \\\\na zoning code, should be addressed as part of the agreement between the owner and the contractor.  \\\\n❏ 2. Renailing wood decks: When replacing roofing, the existing wood roof deck may have to be \\\\nrenailed in accordance with the current provisions of Chapter 16 (High Velocity Hurricane Zones) of the \\\\nFlorida Building Code. (The roof deck is usually concealed prior to removing the existing roof system).  \\\\n❏ 3. Common roofs: Common roofs are those which have no visible delineation between neighboring \\\\nunits (i.e. townhouses, condominiums, etc.). In buildings with common roofs, the roofing contractor and/or \\\\nowner should notify the occupants of adjacent units of roofing work to be performed. \\\\n❏ 4. Exposed ceilings: Exposed, open beam ceilings are where the underside of the roof decking can \\\\nbe viewed from below. The owner may wish to maintain the architectural appearance; therefore, roofing \\\\nnail penetrations of the underside of the decking may not be acceptable. The owner provides the option of \\\\nmaintaining this appearance.  \\\\n❏ 5. Ponding water: The current roof system and/or deck of the building may not drain well and may \\\\ncause water to pond (accumulate) in low-lying areas of the roof. Ponding can be an indication of structural \\\\ndistress and may require the review of a professional structural engineer. Ponding may shorten the life \\\\nexpectancy and performance of the new roofing system. Ponding conditions may not be evident until the \\\\noriginal roofing system is removed. Ponding conditions should be corrected. \\\\n❏ 6. Overflow scuppers (wall outlets): It is required that rainwater flow off so that the roof is not \\\\noverloaded from a buildup of water. Perimeter/edge walls or other roof extensions may block this \\\\ndischarge if overflow scuppers (wall outlets) are not provided. It may be necessary to install overflow \\\\nscuppers in accordance with the requirements of: Chapter 15 and 16 herein and the Florida Building Code, \\\\nPlumbing. \\\\n', 'page_2': '❏ 7. Ventilation: Most roof structures should have some ability to vent natural airflow through the \\\\ninterior of the structural assembly (the building itself). The existing amount of attic ventilation shall not \\\\nbe reduced. \\\\n❏ 8. Existing Solar Systems: The re-installation of an existing roof mounted photovoltaic system \\\\nrequires a separate permit. Permit must be obtained in order to finalize the roofing permit.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n________________________________  \\\\n____________ \\\\nContractor’s Signature \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDate \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n_____________________________   \\\\n___________ \\\\nOwner’s/Agent’s Signature   \\\\n \\\\nDate \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nProperty Address: _______________________________________________________________ \\\\n \\\\nCity: _____________  State: _____________  Zip: _______________ \\\\n'}\",\n",

As it pertains to this section. It is the responsibility of the roofing contractor to provide the owner with the \\\\nrequired roofing permit, and to explain to the owner the content of this section. The provisions of Section RR4402 govern the \\\\nminimum requirements and standards of the industry for roofing system installations. Additionally, the following items should \\\\nbe addressed as part of the agreement between the owner and the contractor. The owner\\'s initial in the designated space \\\\nindicates that the item has been explained. \\\\n\\\\uf0f0 \\\\nAesthetics-Workmanship: \\\\n The \\\\n workmanship provisions \\\\n of \\\\n Section \\\\n RR4402 \\\\n are for \\\\n the purpose \\\\n of providing that \\\\n the \\\\nroofing system \\\\n meets \\\\n the \\\\n wind \\\\n resistance \\\\n and water \\\\n intrusion \\\\n performance standards. Aesthetics \\\\n (appearance) are not a \\\\nconsideration with \\\\n respect to workmanship provisions. \\\\n Aesthetic \\\\n issues \\\\n such as \\\\n color or architectural \\\\n appearance that are not \\\\npart of a zoning code should be addressed as part of the agreement between the own and the \\\\n contractor. \\\\n\\\\uf0f0 \\\\nRenailing \\\\n Wood \\\\n Decks: When replacing roofing, \\\\n the existing wood \\\\n roof deck \\\\n may \\\\n have \\\\n to \\\\n be \\\\n renailed \\\\n in \\\\n accordance with \\\\nthe current provisions of Section RR4402. (The roof deck is usually concealed prior to removing \\\\n the \\\\n existing roof \\\\n system.) \\\\n\\\\uf0f0 \\\\nCommon \\\\n Roofs: Common \\\\n roofs \\\\n are those which \\\\n have no \\\\n visible delineation \\\\n between \\\\n neighboring \\\\n units \\\\n (i.e., townhouses, \\\\ncondominiums, etc.). In buildings \\\\n with common \\\\n roofs, the \\\\n roofing \\\\n contractor and/or \\\\n owner \\\\n should notify \\\\n the \\\\n occupants \\\\n of \\\\nadjacent units of roofing work to be \\\\n performed. \\\\n\\\\uf0f0 \\\\nExposed \\\\n Ceilings: Exposed, open \\\\n beam ceilings \\\\n are \\\\n where the underside \\\\n of the roof decking \\\\n can \\\\n be viewed \\\\n from \\\\n below. \\\\nThe \\\\n owner may \\\\n wish to maintain the \\\\n architectural \\\\n appearance; therefore, roofing nail \\\\n penetrations \\\\n of the \\\\n underside \\\\n of the \\\\ndecking \\\\n may not be acceptable. This provides the option of maintaining this \\\\n appearance. \\\\n\\\\uf0f0 \\\\nPonding \\\\n Water: \\\\n The \\\\n current roof system \\\\n and/or \\\\n deck \\\\n of the building \\\\n may \\\\n not \\\\n drain well \\\\n and \\\\n may \\\\n cause \\\\n water \\\\n to \\\\n pond \\\\n(accumulate in low-lying areas \\\\n of the \\\\n roof). Ponding \\\\n can \\\\n be an indication \\\\n of structural \\\\n distress \\\\n and may \\\\n require the review of a \\\\nprofessional \\\\n structural \\\\n engineer. Ponding may \\\\n shorten \\\\n the life expectancy \\\\n and performance \\\\n of \\\\n the \\\\n new \\\\n roofing \\\\n system. \\\\nPonding conditions may not be evident until the original roofing system is removed. Ponding conditions should be \\\\n \\\\ncorrected. \\\\n\\\\uf0f0 \\\\nOverflow \\\\n Scuppers (wall \\\\n outlets): \\\\n It is \\\\n required \\\\n that rainwater \\\\n flows \\\\n off \\\\n so that the \\\\n roof is \\\\n not overloaded \\\\n from \\\\n a buildup \\\\nof water. Perimeter/edge \\\\n walls \\\\n or other \\\\n roof extensions \\\\n may \\\\n block \\\\n this \\\\n discharge \\\\n if overflow scuppers \\\\n (wall \\\\n outlets) \\\\n are not \\\\nprovided. It may be necessary to install scuppers in accordance with the requirements of \\\\n RR4403 \\\\n and \\\\n RR4413. \\\\n\\\\uf0f0 \\\\nVentilation: \\\\n Most \\\\n roof \\\\n structures \\\\n should \\\\n have \\\\n some ability \\\\n to \\\\n vent \\\\n natural \\\\n air \\\\n flow through the \\\\n interior of the structural \\\\nassembly \\\\n (the \\\\n building itself). The \\\\n existing \\\\n amount of \\\\n attic \\\\n ventilation shall \\\\n not be reduced. It may \\\\n be beneficial \\\\n to consider \\\\nadditional venting which can result in extending the service life of the \\\\n roof. \\\\nOwner’s/Agent’s \\\\n Signature \\\\n \\\\nDate \\\\n \\\\nContractor’s \\\\n Signature \\\\n \\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\n\"}',\n",

I understand that state law requires construction to be done by a licensed contractor and have applied for \\\\nan owner-builder permit under an exemption from the law. The exemption specifies that I, as the owner \\\\nof the property listed, may act as my own contractor with certain restrictions even though I do not have a \\\\nlicense. \\\\n2.  I understand that building permits are not required to be signed by a property owner unless he or she is \\\\nresponsible for the construction and is not hiring a licensed contractor to assume responsibility. \\\\n3.  I understand that, as an owner-builder, I am the responsible party of record on a permit. I understand that I \\\\nmay protect myself from potential financial risk by hiring a licensed contractor and having the permit filed \\\\nin his or her name instead of my own name. I also understand that a contractor is required by law to be \\\\nlicensed in Florida and to list his or her license numbers on permits and contracts. \\\\n4.  I understand that I may build or improve a one-family or two-family residence or a farm outbuilding. I \\\\nmay also build or improve a commercial building if the costs do not exceed $75,000. The building or \\\\nresidence must be for my own use or occupancy. It may not be built or substantially improved for sale or \\\\nlease, unless I am completing the requirements of a building permit where the contractor listed on the \\\\npermit substantially completed the project. If a building or residence that I have built or substantially \\\\nimproved myself is sold or leased within 1 year after the construction is complete, the law will presume \\\\nthat I built or substantially improved it for sale or lease, which violates the exemption. \\\\n5.  I understand that, as the owner-builder, I must provide direct, onsite supervision of the construction. \\\\n6.  I understand that I may not hire an unlicensed person to act as my contractor or to supervise persons \\\\nworking on my building or residence. It is my responsibility to ensure that the persons whom I employ \\\\nhave the licenses required by law and by county or municipal ordinance. \\\\n7.  I understand that it is a frequent practice of unlicensed persons to have the property owner obtain an \\\\nowner-builder permit that erroneously implies that the property owner is providing his or her own labor \\\\nand materials. I, as an owner-builder, may be held liable and subjected to serious financial risk for any \\\\ninjuries sustained by an unlicensed person or his or her employees while working on my property. My \\\\nhomeowner\\'s insurance may not provide coverage for those injuries. I am willfully acting as an owner-\\\\nbuilder and am aware of the limits of my insurance coverage for injuries to workers on my property. \\\\n8.  I understand that I may not delegate the responsibility for supervising work to a licensed contractor who \\\\nis not licensed to perform the work being done. Any person working on my building who is not licensed \\\\nmust work under my direct supervision and must be employed by me, which means that I must comply \\\\nwith laws requiring the withholding of federal income tax and social security contributions under the \\\\nFederal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and must provide workers\\' compensation for the employee. I \\\\nunderstand that my failure to follow these laws may be subject me to serious financial risk. \\\\n9.  I agree that, as the party legally and financially responsible for this proposed construction activity, I will \\\\n\", \\'page_2\\': \" \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n   \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n              \\\\n                  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n     \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n     \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nabide by all applicable laws and requirements that govern owner-builders as well as employers.

I understand that I may obtain more information regarding my obligations as an employer from the \\\\nInternal Revenue Service, the United States Small Business Administration, the Florida Department of \\\\nFinancial Services, and the Florida Department of Revenue. I also understand that I may contact the \\\\nFlorida Construction Industry Licensing Board at (850)487-1395 or call.center@dbpr.state.fl.us for more \\\\ninformation about licensed contractors. \\\\n11.  I am aware of, and consent to an owner-builder building permit applied for in my name and understand \\\\nthat I am the party legally and financially responsible for the proposed construction activity at the following \\\\naddress: _____________________________________________________ \\\\n12.  I agree to notify the City Of Oakland Park immediately of any additions, deletions, or changes to any of \\\\nthe information that I have provided on this disclosure. \\\\nLicensed contractors are regulated by laws designed to protect the public. If you contract with a person who \\\\ndoes not have a license, the Construction Industry Licensing Board and Department of Business and \\\\nProfessional Regulation may be unable to assist you with any financial loss that you sustain as a result of a \\\\ncomplaint. Your only remedy against an unlicensed contractor may be in civil court. It is also important for you \\\\nto understand that, if an unlicensed contractor or employee of an individual or firm is injured while working on \\\\nyour property, you may be held liable for damages. If you obtain an owner-builder permit and wish to hire a \\\\nlicensed contractor, you will be responsible for verifying whether the contractor is properly licensed and the \\\\nstatus of the contractor\\'s workers\\' compensation coverage. \\\\nBefore a building permit can be issued, this disclosure statement must be completed and signed by the property \\\\nowner and returned to the local permitting agency responsible for issuing the permit.

I understand that state law requires construction to be done by a licensed contractor and have applied \\\\nfor an owner-builder permit under an exemption from the law. The exemption specifies that I, as the owner \\\\nof the property listed, may act as my own contractor with certain restrictions even though I do not have a \\\\nlicense. \\\\n \\\\n2. I understand that building permits are not required to be signed by a property owner unless he or she \\\\nis responsible for the construction and is not hiring a licensed contractor to assume responsibility. \\\\n \\\\n3. I understand that, as an owner-builder, I am the responsible party of record on a permit. I understand \\\\nthat I may protect myself from potential financial risk by hiring a licensed contractor and having the permit \\\\nfiled in his or her name instead of my own name. I also understand that a contractor is required by law to \\\\nbe licensed in Florida and to list his or her license numbers on permits and contracts. \\\\n \\\\n4. I understand that I may build or improve a one-family or two-family residence or a farm outbuilding. I \\\\nmay also build or improve a commercial building if the costs do not exceed $75,000. The building or \\\\nresidence must be for my own use or occupancy. It may not be built or substantially improved for sale or \\\\nlease. If a building or residence that I have built or substantially improved myself is sold or leased within 1 \\\\nyear after the construction is complete, the law will presume that I built or substantially improved it for \\\\nsale or lease, which violates the exemption. \\\\n \\\\n5. I understand that, as the owner-builder, I must provide direct, onsite supervision of the \\\\nconstruction. \\\\n \\\\n6. I understand that I may not hire an unlicensed person to act as my contractor or to supervise persons \\\\nworking on my building or residence. It is my responsibility to ensure that the persons whom I employ have \\\\nthe licenses required by law and by county or municipal ordinance. \\\\n \\\\n7. I understand that it is a frequent practice of unlicensed persons to have the property owner obtain an \\\\nowner-builder permit that erroneously implies that the property owner is providing his or her own labor and \\\\nmaterials. I, as an owner-builder, may be held liable and subjected to serious financial risk for any injuries \\\\nsustained by an unlicensed person or his or her employees while working on my property. My homeowner’s \\\\ninsurance may not provide coverage for those injuries. I am willfully acting as an owner-builder and am \\\\naware of the limits of my insurance coverage for injuries to workers on my property. \\\\n \\\\n8. I understand that I may not delegate the responsibility for supervising work to a licensed contractor \\\\nwho is not licensed to perform the work being done. Any person working on my building who is not licensed \\\\nmust work under my direct supervision and must be employed by me, which means that I must comply with \\\\nlaws requiring the withholding of federal income tax and social security contributions under the Federal \\\\nInsurance Contributions Act (FICA) and must provide workers’ compensation for the employee. I understand \\\\nthat my failure to follow these laws may subject me to serious financial risk. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n', 'page_2': ' \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPage 2 of 2 \\\\n \\\\n9.

If you contract with a person \\\\nwho does not have a license, the Construction Industry Licensing Board and Department of Business and \\\\nProfessional Regulation may be unable to assist you with any financial loss that you sustain as a result of a \\\\ncomplaint. Your only remedy against an unlicensed contractor may be in civil court. It is also important for \\\\nyou to understand that, if an unlicensed contractor or employee of an individual or firm is injured while \\\\nworking on your property, you may be held liable for damages. If you obtain an owner-builder permit and \\\\nwish to hire a licensed contractor, you will be responsible for verifying whether the contractor is properly \\\\nlicensed and the status of the contractor’s workers’ compensation coverage. \\\\n \\\\nBefore a building permit can be issued, this disclosure statement must be completed and signed by the \\\\nproperty owner and returned to the local permitting agency responsible for issuing the permit.

BY SIGNING THIS STATEMENT, I ATTEST THAT:  \\\\n(Initial to the left of each statement) \\\\n \\\\nI understand that state law requires construction to be done by a licensed contractor and have applied for an \\\\nowner-builder permit under an exemption from the law. The exemption specifies that I, as the owner of the \\\\nproperty listed, may act as my own contractor with certain restrictions even though I do not have a license. \\\\n \\\\nI understand that building permits are not required to be signed by a property owner unless he or she is \\\\nresponsible for the construction and is not hiring a licensed contractor to assume responsibility. \\\\n \\\\nI understand that, as an owner-builder, I am the responsible party of record on a permit. I understand that I may \\\\nprotect myself from potential financial risk by hiring a licensed contractor and having the permit filed in his or her \\\\nname instead of my own name. I also understand that a contractor is required by law to be licensed in Florida and \\\\nto list his or her license numbers on all permit and contracts. \\\\n \\\\nI understand that I may build or improve a one-family or two-family residence or a farm outbuilding. I may also \\\\nbuild or improve a commercial building if the costs do not exceed $75,000. The building or residence must be for \\\\nmy own use or occupancy. It may not be built or substantially improved for sale or lease. If a building or residence \\\\nthat I have built or substantially improved myself is sold or leased within in 1 year after the construction is \\\\ncomplete, the law will presume that I built or substantially improved it for sale or lease, which violates this \\\\nexemption. \\\\n \\\\nI understand that, as the owner-builder, I must provide direct, onsite supervision of the construction. \\\\n \\\\nI understand that I may not hire an unlicensed individual person to act as my contractor or to supervise persons \\\\nworking on my building or residence. It is my responsibility to ensure that the persons whom I employ have the \\\\nlicenses required by law and by county ordinance. \\\\n \\\\nI understand that it is frequent practices of unlicensed persons to have the property owner obtain an owner- \\\\nbuilder permit that erroneously implies that the property owner is providing his or her own labor and materials. I, \\\\nas an owner-builder, may be held liable and subjected to serious financial risk for any injuries sustained by an \\\\nunlicensed person or his or her employees while working on my property. My homeowner’s insurance may not \\\\nprovide coverage for those injuries. I am willfully acting as an owner-builder and am aware of the limits of my \\\\ninsurance coverage for injuries to workers on my property. \\\\n', 'page_2': '□ \\\\n_______________________________________ \\\\nI understand that I may not delegate the responsibility for supervising work to a licensed contractor who is not \\\\nlicensed to perform the work being done. Any person working on my building who Is not licensed must work under \\\\nmy direct supervision and must be employed by me, which means that I must comply with laws requiring the \\\\nwithholding of federal income tax and social security contributions under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act \\\\n(FICA) and must provide workers’ compensation for the employee. I understand that my failure to follow these \\\\nlaws may subject me to serious financial risk. \\\\n \\\\nI agree that, as the party legally and financially responsible for this proposed construction activity, I will abide by all \\\\napplicable laws and requirements that govern owner-builders as well as employers. I also understand that the \\\\nconstruction must comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, building codes, and zoning regulations. \\\\n \\\\nI am of aware of construction practices and I have access to the Florida Building Code. \\\\n \\\\nI understand that I may obtain more information regarding my obligations as an employer from the Internal \\\\nRevenue Service, the United States Small Business Administration, the Florida Department of Financial Services, \\\\nand the Florida Department of Revenue. I also understand that I may contact the Florida Construction Industry \\\\nLicensing Board at 1-850-487-1395 or at www.myflorida.com/dbpr/pro/cilb/ for more information about licensed \\\\ncontractors. \\\\n \\\\nI am aware of, and consent to, an owner-builder building permit applied for in my name and understand that I am \\\\nthe party legally and financially responsible for the proposed construction activity at the address listed below. \\\\n \\\\nI agree to notify the building department immediately of any additions, deletions, or changes to any of the \\\\ninformation that I have provided on this disclosure or in the permit application package. \\\\n \\\\nLicensed contractors are regulated by laws designed to protect the public.

Your only remedy against an unlicensed contractor may be in civil court. It is also important \\\\nfor you to understand that, if an unlicensed contractor or employee of an individual or firm is injured while  \\\\nworking on your property, you may be held liable for damages.

       " '{\\'page_1\\': \"HIGH VELOCITY HURRICANE ZONES REQUIRED \\\\nOWNERS NOTIFICATION FOR ROOFING \\\\nCONSIDERATIONS \\\\nScope. As it pertains to this section. It is the responsibility of the roofing contractor to provide the owner with the \\\\nrequired roofing permit, and to explain to the owner the content of this section. The provisions of Section RR4402 \\\\ngovern the minimum requirements and standards of the industry for roofing system installations. Additionally, the \\\\nfollowing items should be addressed as part of the agreement between the owner and the contractor. The owner\\'s \\\\ninitial in the designated space indicates that the item has been explained. \\\\n1.\\\\nAesthetics-Workmanship: The workmanship provisions of Section RR4402 are for the purpose of providing\\\\nthat the roofing system meets the wind resistance and water intrusion performance standards. Aesthetics\\\\n(appearance) are not a consideration with respect to workmanship provisions. Aesthetic issues such as color or\\\\narchitectural appearance that are not part of a zoning code should be addressed as part of the agreement\\\\nbetween the owner and the contractor. \\\\n2.\\\\nRenailing Wood Decks: When replacing roofing, the existing wood roof deck may have to be renailed in\\\\naccordance with the current provisions of Section RR4402. (The roof deck is usually concealed prior to removing\\\\nthe existing roof system.)\\\\n3.\\\\nCommon Roofs: Common roofs are those which have no visible delineation between neighboring units (i.e.,\\\\ntownhouses, condominiums, etc.). In buildings with common roofs, the roofing contractor and/or owner should \\\\nnotify the occupants of adjacent units of roofing work to be performed.\\\\n4.\\\\nExposed Ceilings: Exposed, open beam ceilings are where the underside of the roof decking can be viewed \\\\nfrom below. The owner may wish to maintain the architectural appearance; therefore, roofing nail\\\\npenetrations of the underside of the decking may not be acceptable. This provides the option of maintaining\\\\nthis appearance.\\\\n5.\\\\nPonding Water: The current roof system and/or deck of the building may not drain well and may cause water\\\\nto pond (accumulate in low-lying areas of the roof). Ponding can be an indication of structural distress and \\\\nmay require the review of a professional structural engineer. Ponding may shorten the life expectancy and\\\\nperformance of the new roofing system. Ponding conditions may not be evident until the original roofing \\\\nsystem is removed. Ponding conditions should be corrected.\\\\n6.\\\\nOverflow Scuppers (wall outlets): It is required that rainwater flows off so that the roof is not overloaded from\\\\na buildup of water. Perimeter/edge walls or other roof extensions may block this discharge if overflow scuppers \\\\n(wall outlets) are not provided. It may be necessary to install scuppers in accordance with the requirements of\\\\nRR4403 and RR4413.\\\\n7.\\\\nVentilation: Most roof structures should have some ability to vent natural air flow through the interior\\\\nof the structural assembly (the building itself). The existing amount of attic ventilation shall not be\\\\nreduced. It may be beneficial to consider additional venting which can result in extending the service life \\\\nof the roof. \\\\nException: Attic spaces, designed by a Florida-licensed engineer or registered architect to eliminate the attic\\\\nventing, venting shall not be required.\\\\nOwner’s/Agent’s Signature \\\\nDate \\\\nContractors Signature \\\\nDate \\\\nRev 2 – 12/15/2022 \\\\nBuilding and Code Services, 901 NW 66th Ave., Margate, FL 33063 • P 954-970-3004 F 954-970-3412 E building@margatefl.com \\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\n\"}',\n",

Proof of ownership is required in the form of a deed or homestead exemption and a Florida ID. \\\\nI am applying for a Building Permit pursuant to the Owner Builder exemption set forth in Florida Statute 489.103. Florida \\\\nlaw requires that I attest to the following statements. \\\\nBY SIGNING THIS STATEMENT, I ATTEST THAT: (Initial to the left of each statement) \\\\nI understand that state law requires construction to be done by a licensed contractor and have applied for an owner-builder permit under \\\\nan exemption from the law. The exemption specifies that I, as the owner of the property listed, may act as my own contractor with certain \\\\nrestrictions even though I do not have a license. \\\\nI understand that building permits are not required to be signed by a property owner unless he or she is responsible for the construction \\\\nand is not hiring a licensed contractor to assume responsibility. \\\\nI understand that, as an owner-builder, I am the responsible party of record on a permit. I understand that I may protect myself from \\\\npotential financial risk by hiring a licensed contractor and having the permit filed in his or her name instead of my own name. I also \\\\nunderstand that a contractor is required by law to be licensed in Florida and to list his or her license numbers on permits and contracts. \\\\nI understand that I may build or improve a one-family or two-family residence or a farm outbuilding. I may also build or improve a \\\\ncommercial building if the costs do not exceed $75,000. The building or residence must be for my own use or occupancy. It may not be \\\\nbuilt or substantially improved for sale or lease. If a building or residence that I have built or substantially improved myself is sold or leased \\\\nwithin 1 year after the construction is complete, the law will presume that I built or substantially improved it for sale or lease, which violates \\\\nthe exemption. \\\\nI understand that, as the owner-builder, I must provide direct, onsite supervision of the construction. \\\\nI understand that I may not hire an unlicensed person to act as my contractor or to supervise persons working on my building or residence. \\\\nIt is my responsibility to ensure that the persons whom I employ have the licenses required by law and by county or municipal ordinance. \\\\nI understand that it is a frequent practice of unlicensed persons to have the property owner obtain an owner-builder permit that \\\\nerroneously implies that the property owner is providing his or her own labor and materials. I, as an owner-builder, may be held liable and \\\\nsubjected to serious financial risk for any injuries sustained by an unlicensed person or his or her employees while working on my property. \\\\nMy homeowner’s insurance may not provide coverage for those injuries. I am willfully acting as an owner-builder and am aware of the \\\\nlimits of my insurance coverage for injuries to workers on my property. \\\\nI understand that I may not delegate the responsibility for supervising work to a licensed contractor who is not licensed to perform the \\\\nwork being done. Any person working on my building who is not licensed must work under my direct supervision and must be employed \\\\nby me, which means that I must comply with laws requiring the withholding of federal income tax and social security contributions under \\\\nthe Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and must provide workers’ compensation for the employee. I understand that my failure to \\\\nfollow these laws may subject me to serious financial risk. \\\\nI agree that, as the party legally and financially responsible for this proposed construction activity, I will abide by all applicable laws and \\\\nrequirements that govern owner-builders as well as employers. I also understand that the construction must comply with all applicable \\\\nlaws, ordinances, building codes, and zoning regulations. \\\\nI understand that I may obtain more information regarding my obligations as an employer from the Internal Revenue Service, the United \\\\nStates Small Business Administration, the Florida Department of Financial Services, and the Florida Department of Revenue.

The provisions of Chapter 15 of the \\\\nFlorida Building Code, Building govern the minimum requirements and standards of the industry for roofing system \\\\ninstallations. Additionally, the following items should be addressed as part of the agreement between the owner and the \\\\ncontractor. The owner’s initial in the designated space indicates that the item was explained. \\\\n1 \\\\n  Aesthetics Workmanship: The workmanship provisions of Chapter 15 (High Velocity Hurricane Zone) are  for \\\\nthe  purpose  of  providing  that  the  roofing  system  meets  the  wind  resistance  and  water  intrusion performance \\\\nstandards. Aesthetics (appearance) are not a consideration with respect to workmanship provisions. Aesthetic issues such \\\\nas color or architectural appearance, that are not part of a zoning code, should be addressed as part of the agreement \\\\nbetween the owner and the contractor. \\\\n2.\\\\nRenailing Wood Decks: When replacing roofing, the existing wood roof deck may have to be renailed in\\\\naccordance with the current provisions of Chapter 16 (High Velocity Hurricane Zones) of the (Code) (the roof deck is\\\\nusually concealed prior to removing the existing system).\\\\n3.\\\\nCommon Roofs:  Common roofs are those which have no visible delineation between neighboring units (i.e.\\\\ntownhouses, condominiums, etc.) In buildings with common roofs, the roofing contractor and/or owner should notify\\\\nthe occupants of adjacent units of roofing work performed.\\\\n4.\\\\nExposed Ceilings: Exposed, open beam ceilings are where the underside of the roof decking can be viewed\\\\nfrom below. The owner may wish to maintain the architectural appearance; therefore, roofing nail penetrations of the\\\\nunderside of the decking may not be acceptable. [The code] provides [an alternate for] maintaining its appearance.\\\\n5.\\\\nPonding Water: The current roof system and/or deck of the building may not drain well and may cause water to\\\\npond (Accumulate) in low-lying areas of the roof. Ponding can be an indication of structural distress and may require\\\\nreview of a professional structural engineer. Ponding may shorten the life expectancy and performance of the new roofing\\\\nsystem. Ponding conditions may not be evident until the original roofing system is removed. Ponding conditions should be\\\\ncorrected.\\\\n6.\\\\nOverflow Scuppers (Wall Outlets): It is require that rainwater flow off so that the roof is not overloaded from a\\\\nbuildup of water. Perimeter/edge walls or other roof extensions may block this discharge if overflown scuppers (Wall\\\\noutlets) are not provided. It may be necessary to install overflow scuppers in accordance with the requirements of\\\\n[Chapter 16].\\\\n7.\\\\nVentilation: Most roof structures should have some ability to vent natural airflow through the interior of the\\\\nstructural assembly (the building itself).

To \\\\nqualify for exemption under this subsection, an owner must personally appear and sign the building permit application and must \\\\nsatisfy local permitting agency requirements, if any proving that the owner has a complete understanding of the owner\\\\\\'s obligations \\\\nunder the law as specified in the disclosure statement in this section.  If any person violates the requirements of this subsection, the \\\\nlocal permitting agency shall withhold final approval, revoke the permit, or pursue any action or remedy for unlicensed activity \\\\nagainst the owner and any person performing work that requires licensure under the permit issued.  The local permitting agency \\\\nshall provide the person with a disclosure statement in substantially the following form:   \\\\n(Please initial each box on the left, after reading the statements.) \\\\nDISCLOSURE STATEMENT \\\\nI understand that state law requires construction to be done by a licensed contractor and have applied for an \\\\nowner-builder permit under an exemption from the law.  The exemption specifies that I as the owner of the \\\\nproperty listed, may act as my own contractor with certain restrictions even though I do not have a license.  \\\\nI understand that building permits are not required to be signed by a property owner unless he or she is \\\\nresponsible for the construction and is not hiring a licensed contractor to assume responsibility. \\\\nI understand that, as an owner-builder, I am the responsible party of record on a permit.  I understand that I may \\\\nprotect myself from potential financial risk by hiring a licensed contractor and having the permit filed in his or her \\\\nname instead of my own name.  I also understand that a contractor is required by law to be licensed in Florida and \\\\nto list his or her license numbers on permits and contracts. \\\\nI understand that I may build or improve a one-family or two-family residence or a farm outbuilding.  I may also \\\\nbuild or improve a commercial building if the costs do not exceed $75,000.  The building or residence must be for \\\\nmy own use or occupancy.  It may not be built or substantially improved for sale or lease.  If a building or \\\\nresidence that I have built or substantially improved myself is sold or leased within 1 year after the construction is \\\\ncomplete, the law will presume that I built or substantially improved it for sale or lease, which violates the \\\\nexemption. \\\\nI understand that, as the owner-builder, I must provide direct, onsite supervision of the construction. \\\\nI understand that I may not hire an unlicensed person to act as my contractor or to supervise persons working on \\\\nmy building or residence.  It is my responsibility to ensure that persons whom I employ have the licenses required \\\\nby law and by county or municipal ordinance. \\\\nI understand that it is a frequent practice of unlicensed persons to have the property owner obtain an owner-\\\\nbuilder permit that erroneously implies that the property owner is providing his or her own labor and materials.  I, \\\\nas an owner-builder, may be held liable and subjected to serious financial risk for any injuries sustained by an \\\\nunlicensed person or his or her employees while working on my property. \\\\nCITY OF HALLANDALE BEACH \\\\nBUILDING INSPECTIONS DIVISION \\\\n400 South Federal Highway \\\\nHallandale Beach, FL 33009 \\\\nOffice 954-457-2220 ⚫ Fax 954-457-1312 \\\\n\\', \\'page_2\\': \"I understand that I may not delegate the responsibility for supervising work to a licensed contractor who is not \\\\nlicensed to perform the work being done.  Any person working on my building who is not licensed must work \\\\nunder my direct supervision and must be employed by me, which means that I must comply with laws requiring \\\\nthe withholding of federal income tax and social security contributions under the Federal Insurance Contributions \\\\nAct (FICA) and must provide workers\\' compensation for the employee.  I understand that my failure to follow \\\\nthese laws may subject me to serious financial risk.  \\\\nI agree that, as the party legally and financially responsible for this proposed construction activity, I will abide by \\\\nall applicable laws and requirements that govern owner-builders as well as employers. I also understand that the \\\\nconstruction must comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, building codes, and zoning regulations.  \\\\nI understand that I may obtain more information regarding my obligations as an employer from the Internal \\\\nRevenue Service, the United States Small Business Administration, the Florida Department of Financial Services, \\\\nand the Florida Department of Revenue.  I also understand that I may contact the Florida Construction Industry \\\\nLicensing Board at 850-487-1395 or myfloridalicense.com/DBPR/pro/CILB for more information about licensed \\\\ncontractors.   \\\\nI am aware of, and consent to, an owner-builder building permit applied for in my name and understand that I am \\\\nthe party legally and financially responsible for the proposed construction activity. \\\\nI agree to notify City of Hallandale Beach Building Inspections Division immediately of any additions, deletions, or \\\\nchanges to any of the information that I have provided on this disclosure. \\\\nLicensed contractors are regulated by laws designed to protect the public.  If you contract with a person who does not have a \\\\nlicense, the Construction Industry Licensing Board and Department of Business and professional regulation may be unable to assist \\\\nyou with any financial loss that you sustain as a result of complaint.  Your only remedy against an unlicensed contractor may be in \\\\ncivil court.  It is also important for you to understand that, if an unlicensed contractor or employee of an individual or firm is injured \\\\nwhile working on your property, you may be held liable for damages.  If you obtain an owner-builder permit and wish to hire a \\\\nlicensed contractor, you will be responsible for verifying whether the contractor is property licensed and the status of the \\\\ncontractor\\'s worker\\'s compensation coverage.    \\\\nBefore a building permit can be issued, this disclosure statement must be completed and signed by the property owner and returned \\\\nto the local permitting agency responsible for issuing the permit.  A copy of the property owner\\'s driver license, the notarized \\\\nsignature of the property owner, or other type of verification acceptable to the local permitting agency is required when the permit \\\\nis issued. \\\\nI have read the above statement and agree to abide by it.

If any person violates the requirements of this subsection, the \\\\nlocal permitting agency shall withhold final approval, revoke the permit, or pursue any action or remedy for unlicensed activity \\\\nagainst the owner and any person performing work that requires licensure under the permit issued.

The exemption specifies that I as the owner of the property listed, may act as my \\\\nown \\\\ncontractor \\\\nwith \\\\ncertain \\\\nrestrictions \\\\neven \\\\nthough \\\\nI \\\\ndo \\\\nnot \\\\nhave \\\\na \\\\nlicense.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nI understand that building permits are not required to be signed by a property owner unless he or she is responsible for the \\\\nconstruction \\\\nand \\\\nis \\\\nnot \\\\nhiring \\\\na \\\\nlicensed \\\\ncontractor \\\\nto \\\\nassume \\\\nresponsibility.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nI understand that, as an owner-builder, I am the responsible party of record on a permit.  I understand that I may protect \\\\nmyself from potential financial risk by hiring a licensed contractor and having the permit filed in his or her name instead of \\\\nmy own name.  I also understand that a contractor is required by law to be licensed in Florida and to list his or her license \\\\nnumbers on permits and contracts.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nI understand that I may build or improve a one-family or two-family residence or a farm outbuilding.  I may also build or \\\\nimprove a commercial building if the costs do not exceed $75,000.  The building or residence must be for my own use or \\\\noccupancy.  It may not be built or substantially improved for sale or lease.  If a building or residence that I have built or \\\\nsubstantially improved myself is sold or leased within 1 year after the construction is complete, the law will presume that I \\\\nbuilt or substantially improved it for sale or lease, which violates the exemption.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nI understand that, as the owner-builder, I must provide direct, onsite supervision of the construction.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nI understand that I may not hire an unlicensed person to act as my contractor or to supervise persons working on my \\\\nbuilding or residence.  It is my responsibility to ensure that persons whom I employ have the licenses required by law and \\\\nby county or municipal ordinance.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nI understand that it is a frequent practice of unlicensed persons to have the property owner obtain an owner-builder permit \\\\nthat erroneously implies that the property owner is providing his or her own labor and materials.  I, as an owner-builder, \\\\nmay be held liable and subjected to serious financial risk for any injuries sustained by an unlicensed person or his or her \\\\nemployees while working on my property.   \\\\n \\\\n\\', \\'page_2\\': \"G:\\\\\\\\Zoning 2009\\\\\\\\Forms and Sample documents\\\\\\\\Website Documents\\\\\\\\Building\\\\\\\\Forms\\\\\\\\ owner.pdf                                                 Modified: 2.26.2014 \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nI understand that I may not delegate the responsibility for supervising work to a licensed contractor who is not licensed to \\\\nperform the work being done.  Any person working on my building who is not licensed must work under my direct \\\\nsupervision and must be employed by me, which means that I must comply with laws requiring the withholding of federal \\\\nincome tax and social security contributions under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and must provide \\\\nworkers\\' compensation for the employee.  I understand that my failure to follow these laws may subject me to serious \\\\nfinancial risk.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nI agree that, as the party legally and financially responsible for this proposed constriction activity, I will abide by all \\\\napplicable laws and requirements that govern owner-builders as well as employers. I also understand that the construction \\\\nmust comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, building codes, and zoning regulations.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nI understand that I may obtain more information regarding my obligations as an employer from the Internal Revenue \\\\nService, the United States Small Business Administration, the Florida Department of Financial Services, and the Florida \\\\nDepartment of Revenue.

If you contract with a person who does not have a license, \\\\nthe Construction Industry Licensing Board and Department of Business and professional regulation may be unable to assist you with \\\\nany financial loss that you sustain as a result of complaint.  Your only remedy against an unlicensed contractor may be in civil court.  \\\\nIt is also important for you to understand that, if an unlicensed contractor or employee of an individual or firm is injured while \\\\nworking on your property, you may be held liable for damages.  If you obtain an owner-builder permit and wish to hire a licensed \\\\ncontractor, you will be responsible for verifying whether the contractor is property licensed and the status of the contractor\\'s worker\\'s \\\\ncompensation coverage.   \\\\n \\\\nBefore a building permit can be issued, this disclosure statement must be completed and signed by the property owner and returned to \\\\nthe local permitting agency responsible for issuing the permit.

It is the responsibility of the roofing contractor to provide the owner with the required roofing permit, and \\\\nto explain to the owner the content of this section. The following items should be addressed as part of the agreement \\\\nbetween the owner and the contractor. The owner’s initials in the designated space indicates that the item has been \\\\nexplained. \\\\n \\\\n1. Aesthetics-workmanship: The workmanship provisions of Chapter 15 (High Velocity Hurricane Zone) are \\\\nfor the purpose of providing that the roofing system meets the wind resistance and water intrusion performance standards. \\\\nAesthetics (appearance) issues are not a consideration with respect to workmanship provisions. Aesthetic issues such as \\\\ncolor or architectural appearance, that are not part of a zoning code, should be addressed as part of the agreement \\\\nbetween the owner and the contractor. \\\\n \\\\n2. Renailing wood decks: When replacing roofing, the existing wood roof deck may have to be renailed in \\\\naccordance with the current provisions of Chapter 16 (High Velocity Hurricane Zones) of the Florida Building Code. (The \\\\nroof deck is usually concealed prior to removing the existing roof system). \\\\n \\\\n3. Common roofs: Common roofs are those which have no visible delineation between neighboring units (i.e. \\\\ntownhouses, condominiums, etc.). In buildings with common roofs, the roofing contractor and/or owner should notify the \\\\noccupants of adjacent units of roofing work to be performed. \\\\n \\\\n4. Exposed ceilings: Exposed, open beam ceilings are where the underside of the roof decking can be viewed \\\\nfrom below. The owner may wish to maintain the architectural appearance; therefore, roofing nail penetrations of the \\\\nunderside of the decking may not be acceptable. The owner provides the option of maintaining this appearance. \\\\n \\\\n5. Ponding water: The current roof system and/or deck of the building may not drain well and may cause water \\\\nto pond (accumulate) in low-lying areas of the roof. Ponding can be an indication of structural distress and may require the \\\\nreview of a professional structural engineer. Ponding may shorten the life expectancy and performance of the new roofing \\\\nsystem. Ponding conditions may not be evident until the original roofing system is removed. Ponding conditions should be \\\\ncorrected. \\\\n \\\\n6. Overflow scuppers (wall outlets): It is required that rainwater flow off so that the roof is not overloaded from \\\\na buildup of water. Perimeter/edge walls or other roof extensions may block this discharge if overflow scuppers (wall \\\\noutlets) are not provided. It may be necessary to install overflow scuppers in accordance with the requirements of: Chapter \\\\n15 and 16 herein and the Florida Building Code, Plumbing. \\\\n \\\\n7. Ventilation: Most roof structures should have some ability to vent natural airflow through the interior of the \\\\nstructural assembly (the building itself). The existing amount of attic ventilation shall not be reduced. \\\\n \\\\n8. Existing Solar System: The re-installation of an existing roof mounted photovoltaic system requires a \\\\nseparate permit.

The provisions \\\\nof Chapter 15 of the Florida Building Code, Building govern the minimum requirements and standards of the \\\\nindustry for roofing system installations. Additionally, the following items should be addressed as part of the \\\\nagreement between the owner and the contractor. The owner’s initial in the designated space indicates that \\\\nthe item was explained.  \\\\n1. \\\\n Aestherics-Wormanship: The workmanship provisions of Chapter 15 (High Velocity Hurricane Zone) \\\\nare for the  purpose  of  providing  that  the  roofing  system  meets  the  wind  resistance  and water  intrusion \\\\nperformance standards. Aesthetics (appearance) are not a consideration with respect to workmanship \\\\nprovisions. Aesthetic issues such as color or architectural appearance, that are not part of a zoning code, \\\\nshould be addressed as part of the agreement between the owner and the contractor. \\\\n2. \\\\n Renailing Wood Decks: When replacing roofing, the existing wood roof deck may have to be renailed \\\\nin accordance with the current provisions of Chapter 16 (High Velocity Hurricane Zones) of the (Code) (the \\\\nroof deck is usually concealed prior to removing the existing system). \\\\n3. \\\\n Common Roofs:  Common roofs are those which have no visible delineation between neighboring \\\\nunits (i.e. townhouses, condominiums, etc.) In buildings with common roofs, the roofing contractor and/or \\\\nowner should notify the occupants of adjacent units of roofing work performed. \\\\n4. \\\\n Exposed Ceilings: Exposed, open beam ceilings are where the underside of the roof decking can be \\\\nviewed from below. The owner may wish to maintain the architectural appearance; therefore, roofing nail \\\\npenetrations of the underside of the decking may not be acceptable. [The code] provides [an alternate for] \\\\nmaintaining its appearance. \\\\n5. \\\\n Ponding Water: The current roof system and/or deck of the building may not drain well and may \\\\ncause water to pond (Accumulate) in low-lying areas of the roof. Ponding can be an indication of structural \\\\ndistress and may require review of a professional structural engineer. Ponding may shorten the life expectancy \\\\nand performance of the new roofing system. Ponding conditions may not be evident until the original roofing \\\\nsystem is removed. Ponding conditions should be corrected. \\\\n6. \\\\n \\\\n Overflow Scuppers (Wall Outlets): It is required that rainwater flow off so that the roof is not \\\\noverloaded from a buildup of water. Perimeter/edge walls or other roof extensions may block this discharge \\\\nif overflown scuppers (Wall outlets) are not provided. It may be necessary to install overflow scuppers in \\\\naccordance with the requirements of [Chapter 16]. \\\\n7. \\\\n Ventilation: Most roof structures should have some ability to vent natural airflow through the interior \\\\nof the structural assembly (the building itself). The existing amount of attic ventilation shall not be reduced; \\\\nit may be beneficial to consider additional venting which can result in extending the service life of the roof. \\\\n \\\\nOwner’s/Agent Signature  \\\\n \\\\n               Date  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nContractor’s Signature  \\\\n \\\\n   Date  \\\\n             Revised: COPP - Jesus Orozco 01/11/2024 \\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\nSIGN\\\\n'}\",\n",
